I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	intelligent
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	able
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	pursue
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	rational
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	experimentally
I-abstract	evaluates
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	conflict
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	limited
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	X-JACK
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	extension
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	JACK
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	art
I-abstract	agent
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	toolkit
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	X-JACK
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	classify
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	conflicts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	compare
I-abstract	X-JACK
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	JACK
I-abstract	experimentally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	stress
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	conflict
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	conflicts
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reason
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	benefit
I-abstract	however
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	noticeable
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	statistically
I-abstract	significant
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	conflict
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	parallelism
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	focuses
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	organization
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	utilizing
I-abstract	AI

I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	provide

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	re

I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	planetary
I-abstract	rovers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	flexible
I-abstract	interface
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	Summary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	chapter
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	brief
I-abstract	review
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	various
I-abstract	aspects
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	prospective
I-abstract	hybrid
I-abstract	semiconductor
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	nanowire
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	molecular
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	integrated
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	combine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	advantages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	dominating
I-abstract	CMOS
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	exibility
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	fabrication
I-abstract	yield
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	electron
I-abstract	molecular
I-abstract	devices
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	nanometer
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	footprint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	devices
I-abstract	would
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	assembled
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	fabricated
I-abstract	nanowire
I-abstract	array
I-abstract	fabric
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	enabling
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	acceptable
I-abstract	fabrication
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Preliminary
I-abstract	estimates
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	devices
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	12
I-abstract	cm
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	unparalleled
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	20
I-abstract	operations
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	cm
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	acceptable
I-abstract	power
I-abstract	consumption
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	below
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	W
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	cm
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	imposes
I-abstract	substantial
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	importantly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	defect
I-abstract	tolerance
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	circuit
I-abstract	architectures
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	plausible
I-abstract	flrst
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	probably
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	embedded
I-abstract	memories
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	stand
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	alone
I-abstract	terabit
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	chips
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Boolean
I-abstract	logic
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	problematic
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	though
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	options
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	explored
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	seems
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	uniquely
I-abstract	suitable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	crossbar
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	CrossNet
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	neuromorphic
I-abstract	networks
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	advanced
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	least
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	classiflcation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	quite
I-abstract	possibly
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	article
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	methodology
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modular
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	redundant
I-abstract	manipulators
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	improved
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	modularity
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	special
I-abstract	decomposition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	manageable
I-abstract	subproblems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	decomposition
I-abstract	corresponds
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	division
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	redundant
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	non

I-abstract	macro
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	mini
I-abstract	substructures
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	separately
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	substructures
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	recently

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	end
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	effector
I-abstract	inertial
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	acceleration
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	treat
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	differences
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	units
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	highly
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	aspect
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	it
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	An

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	control

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	means
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	manipulated
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	anywhere
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	24
I-abstract	hours
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	day
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	respond
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	requests
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	people
I-abstract	located
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	zones
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	periods
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	constant
I-abstract	supervision
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	concerned
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	truly
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	takes
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	integrates
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	coherent
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	autonomously
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	tours
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	recharge
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	batteries
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	required
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Significant
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	made
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	integration
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	localisation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	generously

I-abstract	Fine

I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	suit
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	final
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	adds
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	High
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Level
I-abstract	Controller
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	complete
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	seamless
I-abstract	integration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	localisation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	recharging
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	controlling
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Long
I-abstract	term

I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	continuous

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	achieved
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	maximum
I-abstract	stretch
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	36
I-abstract	hours
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	no

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Experiments
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	illustrated
I-abstract	weaknesses
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Approaches

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	therefore
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	generating
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	events
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Often
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	at

I-abstract	For

I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cope
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	kinds
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	frequency
I-abstract	infrastructural
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	upgrade
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	frequent
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	bandwidth
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	memoryavailability
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	proposes
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	operating
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	rapidly
I-abstract	changing
I-abstract	environments
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	driven
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	architectural
I-abstract	awareness
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	includes
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	own
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Change
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	triggers
I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	implement
I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	reflective
I-abstract	middleware
I-abstract	layer
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	admits
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	customization
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	loading
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	modification
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	dispatch
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	addresses
I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	through

I-abstract	solar
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	like

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	reality
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	companions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	projected
I-abstract	masses
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	M

I-abstract	)
I-abstract	ranging
I-abstract	from

I-abstract	.

I-abstract	M
I-abstract	J
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	undeniable
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	commonly
I-abstract	held
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	majority
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	\extrasolar
I-abstract	planets
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	argument
I-abstract	advanced
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	extrasolar
I-abstract	planets
I-abstract	involves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	M
I-abstract	sin
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	here
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	statistical
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	objectively
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assertion
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	indeed
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	strongly
I-abstract	suggest
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bulk
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	companions
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	extrasolar
I-abstract	planets
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	assertion
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	unfounded
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Indeed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	likely
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	LMCs
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	homogeneous
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	orbital
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	mass
I-abstract	parameters
I-abstract	essentially
I-abstract	indistinguishable
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	stellar
I-abstract	companions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	say
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	continuation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	stellar
I-abstract	mass
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	formation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	star
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	character
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	planetary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Indeed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	entirely
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	astronomical
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	between

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	will
I-abstract	limit

I-abstract	'
I-abstract	perceived

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	investigate
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	preferences
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	three

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	shows

I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	dependency
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	itself
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	words
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	causal
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	messages
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	starts
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	terminates
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	From
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	corresponds
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fact
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	belongs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	least
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	consistent
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	So
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	could
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	restarting
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	occurrence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	failure
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	minimal
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	NZC
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	open
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	defines
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	minimal
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Z
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	cycles
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	namely
I-abstract	Core
I-abstract	Z-C
I-abstract	ycles
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	CZCs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	absent
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	satisfies
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	NZC
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	induced
I-abstract	checkpointing
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	prevents
I-abstract	CZCs
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	thefly
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	actually
I-abstract	removes
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	whose
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	causal
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	CZC
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	taxonomy
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	induced

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	querying

I-abstract	where
I-abstract	parts

I-abstract	Naive
I-abstract	execution

I-abstract	is

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	ignores
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	queries

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	may

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	optimize
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	query
I-abstract	using

I-abstract	;
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	polynomial

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	finds

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	provably
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	-

I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	commercial
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	academic
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	nature
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tool
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	remains
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	)
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	its

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Yet
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	message
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	CAD
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	planned
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	practical
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	supervised
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	expected
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	generalization
I-abstract	capability
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	completed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	One
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	improving
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	generalization
I-abstract	capability
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	add

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	human
I-abstract	beings
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	seems
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	build
I-abstract	posterior
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	upon
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which

I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	incremental
I-abstract	projection
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	IPL
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	IPL
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	exactly
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	result
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	Algorithms
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	constructing
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	MDD's
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	provided

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	are

I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	handled
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	MDD

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	With
I-abstract	good

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	within
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	Various
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	encoding
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	discussed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	represents
I-abstract	just
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	beginning
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	exploring
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	MDD's
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	are
I-abstract	encouraging
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	setting
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	symbolic
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	MDD's
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	One
I-abstract	exciting
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	involves
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	both

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	guidance
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	by

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	enactable
I-abstract	guidelines
I-abstract	embodied

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	Two

I-abstract	are
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	step

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	supports
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	gives

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using

I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	elementary

I-abstract	The
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	apply
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	setting
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	algebraic
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	obtaining
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	lower

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	word
I-abstract	RAM

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	third
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	gives

I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	weaker

I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	this

I-abstract	Fourier

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Technical
I-abstract	ingredients
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	incompressibility
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Ben
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Amram
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Galil
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	superconcentrators
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Radhakrishnan
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Ta
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Shma
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	incompressibility
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	arithmetic
I-abstract	computation
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	below
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	determines

I-abstract	It

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	Moreover
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	precludes
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	formulate
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	from

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	These

I-abstract	with

I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	frame
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	contents
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Second
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	neural

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	method
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	traditional
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	protocols
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	inappropriate
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	multimedia
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	reasons
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	introduces
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	delay
I-abstract	unacceptable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	isochronous
I-abstract	streams
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	it

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	difficult
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	typical
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	an

I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	adaptable
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	allowing

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	-

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	:

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	inferential
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	abductive
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Inference
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	best
I-abstract	explanation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	economic
I-abstract	semantic
I-abstract	paths
I-abstract	produced
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	linguistic
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	controlled
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	intrinsic

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	devised
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	plausible
I-abstract	semantic
I-abstract	relation
I-abstract	chains
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	inferred
I-abstract	whenever
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	collide
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	trajectories
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	colliding
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	abductive
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	marker
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	stands
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	implication
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Markers
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	semantic
I-abstract	constrains
I-abstract	throughout
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	evaluating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	plausibility
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	inference
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	inferential
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	aims
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	producing
I-abstract	interpretations
I-abstract	accountable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	commonsense
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	novelty
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	evolves
I-abstract	when

I-abstract	For
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	might
I-abstract	appear
I-abstract	after

I-abstract	reflected
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Such
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	complicate
I-abstract	usage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	traditionally
I-abstract	static
I-abstract	constraint

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	automatically
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	aligned
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	subset
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	with

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	apply
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	globin
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	proteins
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	purely
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	globin
I-abstract	fold
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	divided
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	greater
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	residues
I-abstract	near
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	heme
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	F
I-abstract	helix
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	G
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	H
I-abstract	helices
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	lesser
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	repressor
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	B
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	E
I-abstract	helices
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	remainder
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	G
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	H
I-abstract	helices
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Such
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	division
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	consistent
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	biochemical
I-abstract	findings
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	partitions
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	biological
I-abstract	significance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	globin
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	reference
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	definition
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	conservation
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	necessarily
I-abstract	agree
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	similarity
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	appearance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	depends
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	viewpoint
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	observed
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	light
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	illuminated
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	appearance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	never
I-abstract	identical
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	always
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	distinguished
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	recognized
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	arises
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	What
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	consider
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	light
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	attached
I-abstract	shadows
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	pixel
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Lambertian
I-abstract	reflectance
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	illuminated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	light
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	infinity
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	polyhedral
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	IR
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dimension
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	equals
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	distinct
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	normals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	constructed
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	properly
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	pixel
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	reflectance
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	seen
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	IR
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	immediately
I-abstract	suggest
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Throughout
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	offer
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	demonstrating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	empirical
I-abstract	validity
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	describes

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	-
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	setting

I-abstract	in

I-abstract	with

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analyzes
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	artificial
I-abstract	markets
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	maintaining
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	online
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stock
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Previous
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	led
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	price
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	setting
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	achieved
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	practice
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	whereas
I-abstract	empirical
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	focused
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	heuristics
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	lack
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	justification
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	thesis
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	theoretically
I-abstract	justified
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	finance
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	flexible
I-abstract	enough
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	easily
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	incorporating
I-abstract	modules
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	considerations
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	portfolio
I-abstract	risk
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	competition
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	experimentally
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	artificial
I-abstract	markets
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	settings
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	reasonable
I-abstract	real

I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	emerge
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	spread
I-abstract	increases
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	uncertainty
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	true
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stock
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	spreads
I-abstract	tend
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	volatile
I-abstract	markets
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	lower
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	spreads
I-abstract	perform
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	environments
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	competitive
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	series
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	generated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	markets
I-abstract	populated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	replicate
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	TBDD's
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	considerably
I-abstract	enlarges
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Boolean
I-abstract	functions
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be

I-abstract	manipulated
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	OBDD's
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	done
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	applying
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	transformations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	*

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	leading

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	consider
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	automatically
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	traffic
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	city
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Such
I-abstract	automatic
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	efficiency
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	decreasing
I-abstract	delays
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	increasing
I-abstract	capacity
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	easing
I-abstract	congestion
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	thought
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	belonging
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	layer
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	corresponding
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	responsible
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	generating
I-abstract	timed
I-abstract	trajectories
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	individual
I-abstract	vehicles
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	addressed
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	cars
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	roads
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Each
I-abstract	car
I-abstract	has

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	symmetric
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	symmetric
I-abstract	matrices
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	former
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	constructive
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	latter
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	metaheuristic
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	heuristic
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	machines
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Both
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	literature
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	suited
I-abstract	only

I-abstract	symmetric
I-abstract	cases

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	trying
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	paraphrases
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	Japanese
I-abstract	news
I-abstract	articles
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	Information
I-abstract	Extraction
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	focused
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fact
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	reported
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	article
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	differ
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	ent
I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	kinds
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	noun
I-abstract	phrases
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	names
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	dates
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	behave
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	anchors
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	unlikely
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	across
I-abstract	articles
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	anchors
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	comparable
I-abstract	articles
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	extract
I-abstract	portions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	share
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	anchors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	extract
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	convey
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Obtained
I-abstract	paraphrases
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	templates
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	stored
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	future
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	paraphrase
I-abstract	acquisition
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	divided
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	roughly
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	steps
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	explained
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	turn
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	encounter
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	texts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	coreference
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	restriction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	portions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	conclusions
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	dissertation
I-abstract	addresses
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	bottleneck
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	file
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	updated
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	weakly
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	connected
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	proposes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	update
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	ships
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	updated
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	themselves
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	across
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	weak
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	ship
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	sent
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	surrogate
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	strongly
I-abstract	connected
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	surrogate
I-abstract	replays
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	checks
I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	identical
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	originals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	send
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	behalf
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	failure
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	fall
I-abstract	back
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Note
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	neither
I-abstract	compromises
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	nor
I-abstract	hampers
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	scalability
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shippings
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	transparent
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	aware
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Their
I-abstract	feasibilities
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	benefits
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	demonstrated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	evaluation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	realistic
I-abstract	prototypes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	prototypes
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Coda
I-abstract	File
I-abstract	System
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Bourne
I-abstract	Again
I-abstract	Shell
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	bash
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	GIMP
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	bash
I-abstract	shell
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	shell
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	works
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	Coda
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	transparent
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	GIMP
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	works
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	Coda
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	aware
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	former
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	noninteractive
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	modified
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	involved
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	ii
I-abstract	iii
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	latter
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	moderate
I-abstract	modifications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	prototypes
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	evaluated
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	controlled
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	demonstrated
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	huge
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	improvements
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	ranged
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	40
I-abstract	percents
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	nearly
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	orders
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	magnitude
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	reduced
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	traffic
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	elapsed
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Besides
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	made
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	contributions
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	fixing
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	repeating
I-abstract	side
I-abstract	effects
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	forward
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	correction
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	temporary
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	file
I-abstract	renaming
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	enabling
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cancellation
I-abstract	optimization
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	alternatives
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Accurate
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	essential
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	modern
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	deeply
I-abstract	pipelined
I-abstract	microprocessors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	critical
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	fetching
I-abstract	instructions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	deliver
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	sizes
I-abstract	shrink
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	increase
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	delay
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	decrease
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	accessed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tradeoff
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	latency
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Deeper
I-abstract	pipelines
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	allowing
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	aggressive
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	lost
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	increased
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	misprediction
I-abstract	penalties
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Ironically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	shorter
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	periods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	might
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	scaled
I-abstract	back
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	faster
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	decreases
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	advantage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	breaking
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	tradeoff
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	latency
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	fall
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	broad
I-abstract	categories
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	purely
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	implementations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	off
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	load
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	organizations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	extend
I-abstract	traditional
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	highly
I-abstract	accurate
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	organization
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	multi
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	fast
I-abstract	delay
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	sensitive
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	off
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	loads
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	profiling
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	compiler

I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	contributions
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	follows
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	analyze

I-abstract	Throughput
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	largely
I-abstract	improved
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	under
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	scalar
I-abstract	quantization
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Adaptivity
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	compression
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	statistics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	priori
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	quantized
I-abstract	samples
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	require
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	side
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	sent
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	adapt
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	changing
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	statistics
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	quantization
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	backward
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	separated
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	building
I-abstract	blocks
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	namely
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	changing
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	redesign
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	standard
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	smoothness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	various
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	argue
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wide
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	smooth
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	pdf
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	approximation
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	approximation
I-abstract	becoming
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	increases
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	loss
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	adaptivity
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	minimal
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	typical
I-abstract	scenarios
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	our

I-title	:
I-title	A
I-title	Bayesian
I-title	Approach
I-title	for

I-title	Objects
B-author	Paul

I-author	Viola
I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	Bayesian
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	insight
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	modeled
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	conjunction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	themselves
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	CFR
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	unique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	reasons
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	broadly
I-abstract	applicable
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wide
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	constructing
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	easy
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	capable
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	identity
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	computationally
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	requiring
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	propor
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	tional
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	edge
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	CFR
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	experience
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	contains
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	edge
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	correspondences
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	CFR
I-abstract	takes
I-abstract	advantage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Oriented
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	eliminate
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	describes
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	experience
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	MaJIC
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	just
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	intime
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	MATLAB
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	past
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	projects
I-abstract	claimed
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	improvements
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	MATLAB
I-abstract	code
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Most
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	projects
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	static
I-abstract	compilers
I-abstract	suited
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	batch
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	MaJIC
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	just

I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	compilation
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	transparent
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	impacts
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modus
I-abstract	operandi
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	few
I-abstract	interesting
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	with

I-abstract	indicate
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	speedups
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	unbalanced
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	removal
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	yet
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	neglected
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	!ect.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	importance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	distinguishing
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	partners
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	contacts
I-abstract	per

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	assuming
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	people
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	partners
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	fewer
I-abstract	contacts
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	partner
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	people
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	few
I-abstract	partners
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	found
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	epidemic
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	sensitive
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	partner
I-abstract	acquisition
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	might
I-abstract	expect
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	transmission
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	HIV
I-abstract	per

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	low

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Modeling
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	distinction
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	particularly
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	estimating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	impact
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	which

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	let

I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	L
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	establish
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dyadic

I-abstract	by

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	best
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	those

I-abstract	differ
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	with
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Localization
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fundamental
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robotics
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Without
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	carry
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	Markov
I-abstract	localization
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	estimating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	maintain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	whole
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	able
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	globally
I-abstract	localize
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	scratch
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	recover
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	localization
I-abstract	failures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	essential
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	truly
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	probabilistic
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	against
I-abstract	approximate
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment

I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	includes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	filtering
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	densely
I-abstract	populated
I-abstract	environments
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	furthermore
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	exploited
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	even

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	uncertain
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	here
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	tested
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	A

I-abstract	di

I-abstract	arrays
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	good

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	complicates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	construction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	requires
I-abstract	immense

I-abstract	A

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Interactive
I-abstract	heavyweight
I-abstract	services
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	processes
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	intensive
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	computing
I-abstract	power
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	bandwidth
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	storage
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	nature
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	services
I-abstract	means
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	satisfy
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	requests
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	timely
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	kind
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	service
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	remote
I-abstract	visualization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	massive

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	visualization
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	execute
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	series
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	compute
I-abstract	intensive
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	heavyweight
I-abstract	services
I-abstract	usually
I-abstract	encounter
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	limited
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	heterogeneous
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deploy
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	service
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	frames
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	easily
I-abstract	enables
I-abstract	us
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	move
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	compute
I-abstract	hosts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	With
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	heavyweight
I-abstract	services
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	aggregate
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	compute
I-abstract	hosts
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	satisfy
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	request
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	frame
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	selection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	satisfy
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	request
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	accomplished
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	delegating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resource
I-abstract	selection
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	scheduler
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	flexible
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	significant

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	existing

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	powerful
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	in

I-abstract	some
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	\outputs
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	"
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	thesis
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	generate
I-abstract	upper
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	lower
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	outputs
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	hyperbolic
I-abstract	partial
I-abstract	differential
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	outputs
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	interest
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	functionals
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	construction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	\augmented"
I-abstract	Lagrangian
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	includes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	formulation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	quadratic
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	minimized
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	equilibrium
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	corresponding
I-abstract	La
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	grange
I-abstract	multiplier
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	determined
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	involving
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	operator
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	original
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	unconstrained
I-abstract	max
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	min
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	evaluated
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	max
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	min
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	implies
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	original
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	fine
I-abstract	grid
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	approximated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	coarser
I-abstract	grid
I-abstract	followed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	interpolation
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fine
I-abstract	grid
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approximation
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	optimized
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	choice
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	boundary
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	selecting
I-abstract	he
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stabilization
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	Hierarchical
I-abstract	Bounds
I-abstract	Method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	illustrated
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	convection
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	diffusion
I-abstract	equation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	sharp
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	purely
I-abstract	convective
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	discretized
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Taylor
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Galerkin
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	third
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Euler
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	nozzle
I-abstract	flow
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	reduced
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	nonlinear
I-abstract	scalar
I-abstract	continuous
I-abstract	equation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	nonlinear
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Taylor
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Galerkin
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	solved
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Newton
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Raphson
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	linearized
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computed
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	obtain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	produce
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	last
I-abstract	chapter
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Domain
I-abstract	Decomposition
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	introduced
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	decomposed
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	subdomains
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	solved
I-abstract	separately
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	continuity
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	boundaries
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	imposed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	allowing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	parallelized
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	sparse
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	inversion
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	O
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	N
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	Domain
I-abstract	Decomposition
I-abstract	becomes
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	divided
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	D
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	genus
I-abstract	zero
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	represented
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	spherical
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	nearly
I-abstract	uniform
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	connectivity
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	forward
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	intrinsic
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	invariant
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	rigid
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	factor
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	regularity
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inverse
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	always
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	recovered
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	iterative
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	synthesizing
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	becomes
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	interpolating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distributions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interpolated
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	back
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	D
I-abstract	morph
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distance
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distributions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	quantitatively
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	synthesis
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	yeild
I-abstract	smooth
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	migration
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Experiments
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	produces

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	unexpected
I-abstract	convergence
I-abstract	behaviour
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	genetic
I-abstract	Programming
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	GP
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Firstly
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relationship
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	attainable
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Secondly
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	attempt
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	understand
I-abstract	why
I-abstract	GP
I-abstract	classifiers
I-abstract	sometimes
I-abstract	fail
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reach
I-abstract	satisfactory
I-abstract	levels
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	regardless
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	investigation
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	artificially
I-abstract	generated
I-abstract	dataset
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	advance
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	exploration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Results
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	artificial
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	increasing
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	larger
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	sizes
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	generations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	success
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	outweighs
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	success
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Also
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	runs
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	populations
I-abstract	running
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	generations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	became
I-abstract	stagnant
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	were
I-abstract	unable
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	acceptable
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	reflected
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	From
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	sub
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	unsuccessful
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	noted
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	were
I-abstract	almost
I-abstract	always
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	were
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	absent
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	unsuccessful
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Also
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	variety
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	appeared
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	unsuccessful
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	were
I-abstract	never
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	ones
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Evidence
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	runs
I-abstract	suggests
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	paths
I-abstract	leading
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	sub
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	branches
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	evolutionary
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Additionally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	suggest
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	suboptimal
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	mirror
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	deception
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	genetic
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	relatively
I-abstract	greater
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	chances
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	GP
I-abstract	finding
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	reduced
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	starting
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	bottom
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	little
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	assumed
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	explore
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	bottom
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	operators
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	classify
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	contain
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	cues
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	occlusion
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	transparency
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	bends
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Like
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	human
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	begin
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	directions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	create
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filter
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	orientation
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	describing
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	combination
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	basis
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filtering
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	call
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	offers
I-abstract	advantages
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	computation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	variety
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	quadrature
I-abstract	pairs
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	measure
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	orientation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	texture
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	enhancement
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	post
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	filter
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	orientations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	detector
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	maxima
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	contour
I-abstract	phases
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	maxima
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	compare
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	respond
I-abstract	selectively
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	\T",
I-abstract	\L",
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	\X"
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	T
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	X
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	indicate
I-abstract	occlusion
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	transparency
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	respectively
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	detectors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	cues
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	built
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	resemble
I-abstract	responses
I-abstract	found
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	junction
I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	salient
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	combine
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	contour
I-abstract	detector
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	saliency
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Shashua
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Ullman
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	finds
I-abstract	visually
I-abstract	salient
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	descriptive
I-abstract	power
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	include
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	competitive
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	From
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	configuration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	saliencies
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	detectors
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	respond
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cues
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	occlusion
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	transparency
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	bending
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	saliency
I-abstract	values
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	curve
I-abstract	linking
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	synthetic
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	complicated
I-abstract	scenes
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	why
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Each
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	calculations
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	throughout
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	assumes
I-abstract	little
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	it

I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	constructively
I-abstract	demonstrates
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	A

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	It

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	values
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	appropriate
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	initialization
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	investigate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	iterative
I-abstract	Gaussian
I-abstract	splitting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	EM
I-abstract	training
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	HMM
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	or

I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	merging
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Gaussians
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	contain
I-abstract	little
I-abstract	training
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	Gaussian
I-abstract	merging
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	combined
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	form

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Detailed
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	studies
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	Gaussian
I-abstract	splitting
I-abstract	gives
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	training
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	though
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	different

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	Gaussian
I-abstract	merging
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	better

I-abstract	our

I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	experiment
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	speaker
I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	gave

I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	models
I-abstract	were
I-abstract	trained
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	Gaussian
I-abstract	splitting
I-abstract	alone
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	15

I-abstract	5

I-abstract	though
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	with

I-abstract	They
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	-
I-abstract	driven
I-abstract	semantics
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	role
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	iterative
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	establish
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modified
I-abstract	Gram
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Schmidt
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	why
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modified
I-abstract	Gram
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Schmidt
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	well

I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	vectors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	holds
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assumption
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not

I-abstract	conditioned
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	quantified
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	consequence
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	iterations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	whose
I-abstract	columns
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	orthogonal
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	machine
I-abstract	precision
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	numerical
I-abstract	experiment
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	add
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	regulator
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	add
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	mean
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	operates
I-abstract	harmonically
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	feedback
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	role
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	add
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reject
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	sinusoidal
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	unknown
I-abstract	magnitude
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	phase
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	frequency
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	regulator
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	independent
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	feedback
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	plant
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Advantages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	follows
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	rejection
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	enhanced
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	turned
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	ofi
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	unwanted
I-abstract	transient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	digital
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(3)
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	perfect
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	rejection
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	just
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	reduction
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(4)
I-abstract	Ability
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	perfect
I-abstract	rejection
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	preserved
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	uncertain
I-abstract	plant
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	conflrm
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	adequate
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	debug
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	probe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	removed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	assess
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	gain
I-abstract	confidence
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	reliable
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	names
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	degree
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	debug
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	tend
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	ignore
I-abstract	random
I-abstract	selection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	profile
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	while
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	selection
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Debug
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	thought
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	proof
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	uncovering
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	repaired
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	done
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technically
I-abstract	defensible
I-abstract	assessment
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	On
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	hand
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	accurate
I-abstract	assessment
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	achieving
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	examines
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relationship
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	probabilistic
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	define
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	try
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	theoretically
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	attain
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	Is
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	probing
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	debug
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	assess
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	uncovering
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	accident
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	speak
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	no
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	course
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Testing
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	failures
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	detected
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	changed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	eliminate
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	\better"
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	delivers
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	failures
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	eliminated
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	comparison
I-abstract	extends
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	measure
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	failure
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	integral
I-abstract	part

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	industry
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	United
I-abstract	States
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cable
I-abstract	television
I-abstract	industry
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	institutional
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	economic
I-abstract	determinants
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	growth
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	shown

I-abstract	While
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	inconsistent
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	unfettered
I-abstract	development

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	periods

I-abstract	closely
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	developments
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	ancillary
I-abstract	goal
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	but
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	To

I-abstract	accurately
I-abstract	from

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	feasibility
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	gradually
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lifetime
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	When
I-abstract	faced
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	thing
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	learn
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	acquired
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	improves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	generalize
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	hence
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sample
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	applying
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	perception
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	originally
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	Suddarth
I-abstract	[15]
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	persons
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	locations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	learn
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	fewer
I-abstract	training
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	scratch
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	argue
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	adjusting
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	superior
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	conventional
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	many

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	Our

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	with

I-abstract	real
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	aspects
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	includes
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	characteristics
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	themselves
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	usability
I-abstract	aspects
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	helps
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	concerns
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	early
I-abstract	stages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	take
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	manipulation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	processes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	via
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	respect
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	refine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	composite
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	entities
I-abstract	comprising
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	taken
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	message
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	formulated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	reference
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	understanding
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relationships
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	form
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tightly
I-abstract	integrated
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	extensions
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	come
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	can

I-abstract	trusted
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	security
I-abstract	policy
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	struc
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	turing
I-abstract	raises
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	security
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	enforced
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	access

I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	decomposes
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	policy
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	neutral
I-abstract	enforcement
I-abstract	manager
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	security
I-abstract	policy
I-abstract	manager
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	transparent
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	extensions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	absence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	security
I-abstract	violations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	protection
I-abstract	domains
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	enforces
I-abstract	protection
I-abstract	domains
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	checks
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	performs
I-abstract	auditing
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	operations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	works
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	inspecting
I-abstract	extensions
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	operations
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	determine
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	abstractions
I-abstract	require
I-abstract	protection
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	redirecting
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	or

I-abstract	invocations
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	inject
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	operations
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Until
I-abstract	recently
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	expert

I-abstract	used
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	as
I-abstract	their

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	whereas
I-abstract	expert

I-abstract	need

I-abstract	NDCs
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	difficult
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	because

I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	physical
I-abstract	register
I-abstract	management
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	late
I-abstract	allocation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	end
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	registers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	significant
I-abstract	savings
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	registers
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	shorter
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	register
I-abstract	file
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	virtual
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	physical
I-abstract	registers
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	register
I-abstract	allocation
I-abstract	policy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	policy
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	demand
I-abstract	allocation
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	maximize
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	register
I-abstract	usage
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	combined
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stealing
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	prevents
I-abstract	older
I-abstract	instruction
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	delayed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	younger
I-abstract	ones
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	shortens
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cycles
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	physical
I-abstract	register
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	allocated
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	early
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	instructions
I-abstract	since
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	obtain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	physical
I-abstract	register
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	destination
I-abstract	earlier
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	conventional
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Early
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	especially
I-abstract	beneficial
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	branches

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	work
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	proposed

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	we
I-abstract	focus
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	overloading
I-abstract	caused
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	transmission
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	replicated
I-abstract	streams
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	at

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	help
I-abstract	avert
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these

I-abstract	using

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Software
I-abstract	Engineering
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	discipline
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	aspiration
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	yet
I-abstract	unachieved
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Many
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	reusable
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	structured
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	architectural
I-abstract	studies
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	chiefly
I-abstract	emphasise
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	engineering
I-abstract	product
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.

I-abstract	software
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	frames
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	suggested
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	specialisation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	essential
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	established
I-abstract	branches
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	engineering
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	specialisations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Some
I-abstract	specialisations
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	arisen
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	notably
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	construction
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	personal
I-abstract	computers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	More
I-abstract	are

I-abstract	A

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	decomposition
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	into
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	major

I-abstract	:

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	describe

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	each

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	Model
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	low

I-abstract	description
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	conforms
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	description
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	designs
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	spaces
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	refinement
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	checking
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	decomposed
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	subtasks
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	manageable
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	decompose
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	individual
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	satisfy
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	requirements
I-abstract	un
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	put
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	right
I-abstract	context
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	constrains
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inputs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	verify
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	individually
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	assumptions
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	inputs
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	circular
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	verified
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assumption
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	context
I-abstract	B
I-abstract	behaves
I-abstract	correctly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	symmetrically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	B
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	verified
I-abstract	assuming
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	A.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	guarantee
I-abstract	paradigm
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	systematic
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	methodology
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	ensuring
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	soundness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	circular
I-abstract	style
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	postulating
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discharging
I-abstract	assumptions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tutorial
I-abstract	introduction
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	guarantee
I-abstract	paradigm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	decomposing
I-abstract	refinement
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	checking
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	step
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	detail
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	verification
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	processor
I-abstract	pipeline
I-abstract	against
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	verification
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	stage
I-abstract	pipeline
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	broken
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	subtasks
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	Detection
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	given

I-abstract	in

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be

I-abstract	metrics
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	Secondly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	polynomial
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	target
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	secondary
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	annotate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	different

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	guarantees
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	match
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Even
I-abstract	otherwise
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	computes
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	matches
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Unlike
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	minimized
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	translates
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	root
I-abstract	mean
I-abstract	square
I-abstract	deviation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	RMSD
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	The
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	preprocessing
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	suitable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	motifs
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	[3]
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Briefly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	maintaining
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	static
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	accommodate
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	dynamically
I-abstract	assign
I-abstract	current
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	positions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	fixed
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	assignment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	requires
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	storage
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	assignment
I-abstract	achieves
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	rekeying
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	enhancements
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	evaluation
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	improves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	half
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rekey
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Also
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	7
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	know
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	maximum
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	advance
