I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	days
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	propositional
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	quite
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	understood
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Good
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wealth
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	sometimes
I-abstract	challenging
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	STRIPS
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	style
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	best
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	benchmark
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	established
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	propositional
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	major
I-abstract	drawback
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	formalism
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	too
I-abstract	weak
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	easy
I-abstract	encoding
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	genuinely
I-abstract	interesting
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	specifically
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	involving
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	enhance
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	PDDL
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cope
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	additions
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	numerical
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	third
I-abstract	international
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	competition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	increased
I-abstract	interest
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	contribution
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	STRIPS
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	introduction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	numerical
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	undecidable
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	thereof
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	special
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	decidability
I-abstract	results

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	password
I-abstract	authentication
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	exchange
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	suitable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	authenticating
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	exchanging
I-abstract	keys
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	untrusted
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	resists
I-abstract	dictionary
I-abstract	attacks
I-abstract	mounted
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	passive
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	network

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	allowing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	weak
I-abstract	passphrases
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	safely
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	offers
I-abstract	perfect
I-abstract	forward
I-abstract	secrecy
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	protects
I-abstract	past
I-abstract	sessions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	passwords
I-abstract	against
I-abstract	future
I-abstract	compromises
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	passwords
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	stored
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	plaintext
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	equivalent
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	password
I-abstract	itself
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	attacker
I-abstract	who
I-abstract	captures
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	password
I-abstract	database
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	compromise
I-abstract	security
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	gain
I-abstract	immediate
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	host
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	combines
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	zero
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	proofs
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	asymmetric
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	exchange
I-abstract	protocols
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	offers
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	improved
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	comparably
I-abstract	strong
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	resist
I-abstract	stolen
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	verifier
I-abstract	attacks
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	Augmented

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	addressing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	neocortex
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	hippocampus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	prefrontal
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	None
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	popular
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	temporal
I-abstract	synchrony
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	conjunctive
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	bind
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	ensuring
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	units
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	activated
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	combinations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	think
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	constructs
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	conjunctions
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	coarse
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	coded
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	avoid
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	combinatorial
I-abstract	explosion
I-abstract	usually
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	conjunctive
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	learns
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	challenging
I-abstract	relational
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	furthermore
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	capable
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	considerable
I-abstract	generalization
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	inputs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Next
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	review
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	hippocampus
I-abstract	performs
I-abstract	conjunctive
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	term
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	conjunctions
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	events
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	involves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	phonological
I-abstract	loop
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	maintaining
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	sequences
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	phonemes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	phonological
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	bind
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	repeating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	(

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	green
I-abstract	X's
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	suggests
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	specialized
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	build
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	strengths
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	One
I-abstract	difficulty
I-abstract	with

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	their

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	external
I-abstract	force
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	external
I-abstract	force
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	combination

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	boundary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	force
I-abstract	simultaneously
I-abstract	pulls
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	deals
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	considers
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	learners
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	classes
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analyzes
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Turing
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	degrees
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	containing
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	least
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	no
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	outside
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	learner
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	Turing
I-abstract	degree
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inclusion
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	recursively
I-abstract	enumerable
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sense
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	learner
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	Turing
I-abstract	degree
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	computable
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	learner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	upper
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	grammar
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	oracle
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	sufficient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concepts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	gives
I-abstract	insufficient
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	criteria
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	restrictive
I-abstract	convergence
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	jump
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	itself
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	So
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	infinite
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Therefore

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linear

I-abstract	-

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	In
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	typed
I-abstract	setting
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	contain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	modal
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	constructor
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	classifies
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	code
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	code
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	generally
I-abstract	come
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	flavors
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	closed
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Closed

I-abstract	Recent

I-abstract	combining

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	perceptual
I-abstract	grouping
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	vision
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	focusing
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	consistencies
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	aims
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	extracting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	impression
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	treat
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	segmentation
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	partitioning
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	normalized
I-abstract	cut
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	segmenting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	normalized
I-abstract	cut
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	dissimilarity
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	groups
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	similarity
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	groups
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	eigenvalue
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	optimize
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Previous

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	at

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	we

I-abstract	about

I-abstract	arising
I-abstract	from

I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based

I-abstract	reason
I-abstract	about

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	handle
I-abstract	arbitrary

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	deletion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	values
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	reason
I-abstract	with

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	article
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	despite
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	decades
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	research
I-abstract	characterizing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	V
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	neurons
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	decent
I-abstract	picture
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	V
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	really
I-abstract	operates
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	neurons
I-abstract	represents
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	scenes
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	realistic
I-abstract	viewing
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	five
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	current
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	stem
I-abstract	largely
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	biases
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	contributions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	linearities
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	understood
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	open
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	window
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	theories
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	proposals
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	becoming
I-abstract	increasingly
I-abstract	dependent
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	interconnected
I-abstract	networks
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	One

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	To

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	distribute
I-abstract	GPS
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	below
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	Ethernet
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	SynUTC
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	upon
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	packets
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	leave
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	arrive
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	node
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	comes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	flavours
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	exploited
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	Network
I-abstract	Time
I-abstract	Interface
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	NTI
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	M-M
I-abstract	odule
I-abstract	timestamps
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	packets
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	accesses
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	virtually
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controllers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	Mb
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	Ethernet
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	evaluation
I-abstract	revealed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	down
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Still
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	requires
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controllers
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	store
I-abstract	entire
I-abstract	packets
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	chip
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	configuration
I-abstract	parameters
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	carefully
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cope
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	various
I-abstract	hidden
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	timing
I-abstract	uncertainty
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	escape
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	limitations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	recently
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	MII
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	conjunction
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	almost
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	modern
I-abstract	10/100
I-abstract	Mb
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	Ethernet
I-abstract	chipset
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	sits
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	standard
I-abstract	MII
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	interface
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	transceiver
I-abstract	here
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	below
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	RML
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	intended
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Natural
I-abstract	Semantics

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	basic

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It

I-abstract	Benchmarks
I-abstract	indicate

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	we

I-abstract	begun
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	NLG
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	these

I-abstract	brought

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	an
I-abstract	informal
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	what
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	coherence
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	focus
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	patient
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	leaflets
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	follow

I-abstract	in

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	animated
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	meaning
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	mapped
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	realisation

I-abstract	Throughout
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	stress

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Recently
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	namely
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	was

I-abstract	well
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	(

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	past
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	ordered

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	previous

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	herewith
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	on
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	comparators
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	equivalent
I-abstract	ordered
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	proven
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	transforming

I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	ordered
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	into

I-abstract	These
I-abstract	systems

I-abstract	At

I-abstract	we

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	simplifications
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	improving

I-abstract	like
I-abstract	job

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	modifications
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	combinations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	consecutive

I-abstract	levels
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	frequent
I-abstract	dilemma
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	programming
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	choice
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	rich
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	notations
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	dilemma
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	proposing
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	grammars
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	syntax
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	definition
I-abstract	formalism
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	incremental
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	extensions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	translation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	written
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	rich
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	defined
I-abstract	via
I-abstract	syntax
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	directed
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	macro
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	expansion
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	rewriting
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	grammarsrespect
I-abstract	scoping
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	constructs
I-abstract	while
I-abstract	avoiding
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	unwanted
I-abstract	name
I-abstract	clashes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	grammars
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	extending
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lambda
I-abstract	calculus
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	let
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	bindings
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	conditionals
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	constructs
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	database
I-abstract	programming
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	SQL
I-abstract	query
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	description
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	parsing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	substitution
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	sketch
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	exploited
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	parser
I-abstract	package
I-abstract	.
