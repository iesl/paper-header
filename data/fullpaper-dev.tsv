I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	No
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	sample
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	sufficient
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	determine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	therefore
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	entropy
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	signal
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Some
I-abstract	assumption
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	functional
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	smoothness
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Both
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	functions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	differential
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	rule
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	EMMA
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	optimizes
I-abstract	entropy
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	kernel
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Entropy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	derivative
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	calculated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	sampling
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	update
I-abstract	rule
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	surprisingly
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	EMMA
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	correct
I-abstract	corruption
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	magnetic
I-abstract	resonance
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	MRI
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	beyond
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	scope
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	entropy
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	concurrent
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	localization
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	received
I-abstract	considerable
I-abstract	attention
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robotics
I-abstract	community
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	With
I-abstract	few
I-abstract	exceptions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	largely
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	grouped
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	distinct
I-abstract	paradigms
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	topological
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	metric
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	proposes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	integrates
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	paradigms
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	poses
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	statistical
I-abstract	maximum
I-abstract	likelihood
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	devises
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	likelihood
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	integrates
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	phases
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	topological
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	metric
I-abstract	mappingphase
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	topologicalmappingphasesolvesa

I-abstract	alignment
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	potentially
I-abstract	indistinguishable
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	significant
I-abstract	places
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	subsequent
I-abstract	metric
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	phase
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	fine
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	discusses
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	W-LAN
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	current
I-abstract	status
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	wireless
I-abstract	termination
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	LAN
I-abstract	services
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	infrastructure
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	networks
I-abstract	become
I-abstract	open
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	operators
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	vehicle
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	win
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	win
I-abstract	scenario
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	operators
I-abstract	benefit
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Open
I-abstract	Access
I-abstract	Networks
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	OANs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	go
I-abstract	beyond
I-abstract	wireless
I-abstract	HotSpots
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	shared
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	infrastructure
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	fosters
I-abstract	service
I-abstract	operators
I-abstract	competition
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	drastically
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	last
I-abstract	mile
I-abstract	coverage
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Open
I-abstract	Access
I-abstract	Networks
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	detailed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	highlighting
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	difference
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	traditional
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	vertical
I-abstract	integration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	service
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	About
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	OANs
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quick
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	smooth
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	infrastructure
I-abstract	toward
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	widespread
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reliable
I-abstract	communication

I-abstract	mentioning
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	organization
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	organization
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	final
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	devoted
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	technical

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	To
I-abstract	meet
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	twin
I-abstract	challenges
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	scalability
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	flexibility
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	consistency
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	employs

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	proxies
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	scalable

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	systematic
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	building
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	specifications
I-abstract	expressed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	logic
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	outside
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	conventional
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	theorem
I-abstract	proving
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Tools
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	HOL
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	PVS
I-abstract	integrate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	parsing
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	typechecking
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	substantial
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	theorem
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	proving
I-abstract	functionality
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	taken
I-abstract	\the
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	HOL
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	building
I-abstract	automated
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	top
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	just
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	parser
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	checker
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	eliminate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	burden
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	skilled
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	required
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	conventional
I-abstract	theorem
I-abstract	prover
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	lightweight
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	diverse
I-abstract	purposes
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	refutation
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithmic
I-abstract	generation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	toolset
I-abstract	contains
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	variety
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	utilities
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	manipulation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	logic
I-abstract	specifications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	utility
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	\evaluated"
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	evaluation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	functional
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	utilities
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	combined
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	implement
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	symbolic
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	checking
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	After
I-abstract	five
I-abstract	years
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	experience
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	conclude
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	decoupling
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	conventional
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	retain
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	benefits
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	expressive
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	notation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	generate
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	useful

I-abstract	results
I-abstract	automatically

I-abstract	A

I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	still
I-abstract	allows

I-abstract	On

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	Abstract

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	there

I-abstract	several

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	at

I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	more

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	we

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	since
I-abstract	faces
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	truly
I-abstract	Lambertian
I-abstract	surfaces
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	indeed
I-abstract	produce
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	deviate
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	explicitly
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	deviation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	discounts
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	regions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	face
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	deviation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	projection
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	Fisher's
I-abstract	Linear
I-abstract	Discriminant
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	separated
I-abstract	classes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	severe
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	facial
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	Eigenface
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	linearly

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	requirements
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Yet
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extensive
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	\Fisherface"
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	lower
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	understand
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	molecular
I-abstract	machinery
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cell
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	know
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	multitude
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cell
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	High
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	throughput
I-abstract	technologies
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	fairly
I-abstract	noisy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	predicting
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	could
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	signiOEcant
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	One
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	predicting
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	silico
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	produce
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	OErst
I-abstract	principles
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	detailed
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	candidate
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	take
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	alternative
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	employing
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	relatively
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	learns
I-abstract	dynamically
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	collection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	attraction
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	repulsion
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	pair
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	proteins
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	represented
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sum
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	attractive
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	repulsive
I-abstract	forces
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	sized
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	length
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	discriminative
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	simultaneously
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	pairs
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	proteins
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	suspected
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	interact
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	efOEcient
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	compute
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	scales
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	collections
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	cross
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	validated
I-abstract	comparison
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	yeast
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	attraction
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	repulsion
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	performs
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	competing
I-abstract	techniques

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	TV
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	minimization
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	restoration
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	remove
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	singularity
I-abstract	caused
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	differentiability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quantity
I-abstract	jruj
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	definition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	TV
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	norm
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	apply
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linearization
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	Newton's
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	accomplished
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	introducing
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	flux
I-abstract	quantity
I-abstract	appearing
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	gradient
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	interpreted
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	normal
I-abstract	vector
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	u
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	viewed
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	primal
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dual
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	Conn
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Overton
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	9
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Andersen
I-abstract	[

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.

I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	possessing
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	quadratic
I-abstract	convergence
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	experimental

I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	faster

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	cannot

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	empirical
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	work

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	effect
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	duplicate
I-abstract	keys
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	addressed
I-abstract	analytically
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	practice
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	oversampling
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	undersampling
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Empirically
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	diverse

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	On
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	machines
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	random
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	data
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	PSRS

I-abstract	But
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	good

I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wide

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	overview
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	research
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	complementarity
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	indicate
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Generalized
I-abstract	LCP
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	piecewise
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	resistive
I-abstract	electrical
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Next
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Extended
I-abstract	LCP
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	fundamental
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	arise
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	max
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	algebraic
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	appear
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Since
I-abstract	hybrid
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	exhibit
I-abstract	characteristics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	leads
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	play
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	role
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	certain

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	introduced

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	Navigating
I-abstract	through

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not

I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	links
I-abstract	become
I-abstract	very

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	orientation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	hyperdocument
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	showing

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	mainly
I-abstract	details
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	designers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	goal
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	build
I-abstract	graphical
I-abstract	browsers
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	compositions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	concepts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	nested
I-abstract	composite
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	showing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	importance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	navigation
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	guide
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	hyperspace
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	proposal
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	navigation
I-abstract	browser
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	extends
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fisheye
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	strategy
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	nested
I-abstract	compositions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	outline
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	browser
I-abstract	illustrating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ideas
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Lastly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	major
I-abstract	characteristics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	browsers
I-abstract	providing
I-abstract	spatial

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Animals
I-abstract	possess
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	evolved
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	handle
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	organism
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Likewise
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	controlled
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	fundamental
I-abstract	difference
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	arise
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	fails
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	call
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	exploratory
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	investigate
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	--
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	escaping
I-abstract	behavioral
I-abstract	stasis
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	escaping
I-abstract	behavioral
I-abstract	cycles
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	finding
I-abstract	food
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	chemotaxis
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	containing
I-abstract	obstacles
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	describing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Exploratory
I-abstract	Behavior
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	interested
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	providing
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ability
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	unexpected
I-abstract	events
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Animals
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	repertoire
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	unlike
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	call
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	exploratory
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	would
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	questions
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	would
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	regard
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	exploratory
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	1.
I-abstract	How
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	you
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	failed
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	2.
I-abstract	Once
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	failed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	what
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	you
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	explore
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	actions
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	3.
I-abstract	How
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	you
I-abstract	learn
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	actions
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	--
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	requiring

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	A

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	combiners
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	introduced
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	stages
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	correlated
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	transforms
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	maximum
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	relatively
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	correlation
I-abstract	coefficient
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	calculating
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	polynomial
I-abstract	multiples
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	identified
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	transform
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	applying
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	iterative
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	correction
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	transform
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	observed
I-abstract	keystream
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	determine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	LFSRs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	successfully
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	keystream
I-abstract	generators
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	namely
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	summation

I-abstract	To

I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	The
