<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of collecting responses in multi-hop radio networks is considered. A given node, called the source, is to collect a specified number of 
responses from nodes in a radio network. The problem arises in several 
applications of distributed systems. A deterministic and a randomized protocol for the problem are presented. The two protocols are analyzed and 
their performance is compared. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability 
of our protocols in various network environments.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Proc. of the Int'l Symposium on High Performance 
Computer Architecture (HPCA '95), pp. 200-209. 
This paper presents a new approach to implement fast barrier synchronization in wormhole k-ary 
n-cubes. The novelty lies in using multidestination 
messages instead of the traditional single destination 
messages. Two different multidestination worm types, 
gather and broadcasting, are introduced to implement 
the report and wake-up phases of barrier synchronization, respectively. Algorithms for complete and arbitrary set barrier synchronization are presented using 
these new worms. It is shown that complete barrier 
synchronization in a k-ary n-cube system with e-cube 
routing can be implemented with 2n communication 
start-ups as compared to 2n log 2 k start-ups needed 
with unicast-based message passing. For arbitrary set 
barrier, an interesting trend is observed where the synchronization cost keeps on reducing beyond a certain 
number of participating nodes.  </abstract>

<title> A Trip-based Multicasting Model in 
Wormhole-routed Networks with Virtual Channels  </title>
<author> Yu-Chee Tseng, Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Member, IEEE, and Ten-Hwang Lai, Member, IEEE  </author>
<abstract> Abstract| This paper focuses on efficient multicasting in 
wormhole-routed networks. A trip-based model is proposed 
to support adaptive, distributed, and deadlock-free multiple 
multicast on any network with arbitrary topology using at 
most two virtual channels per physical channel. This model 
significantly generalizes the path-based model proposed earlier [21], [22], which works only for Hamiltonian networks 
and can not be applicable to networks with arbitrary topology resulted due to system faults. Fundamentals of the trip-based model, including the necessary and sufficient condition to be deadlock-free, and the use of appropriate number 
of virtual channels to avoid deadlock are investigated. The 
potential of this model is illustrated by applying it to hyper-cubes with faulty nodes. Simulation results indicate that the 
proposed model can implement multiple multicast on faulty 
hypercubes with negligible performance degradation.  </abstract>

<title> Space Deformation using Ray Deectors  </title>
<author> Yair Kurzion and Roni Yagel  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer and Information Science

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we introduce a new approach to the deformation of surface and raster 
models in two and three dimensions. Rather then deforming the objects in the 
model, we deform the rays used to render the scene. The mechanism to specify the 
deformation, which we call a deector, is a vector of gravity positioned in space. 
This gravity vector bends any ray that travels through its field of gravity. Images 
generated by these curved rays give the impression of a deformed space. Unlike 
previous methods that deform all the objects in the scene, our approach deforms 
only those parts of the model that contribute to the final image. In addition, using 
deectors, our approach can deform any object type that can be rendered by a ray 
casting algorithm, providing a unified solution to space deformation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
It has previously been shown that there exists a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that is considerably worse than nested dissection 
in terms of fill-in and operations for factorization [1]. This paper proves 
the existence of a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that has the 
same optimal asymptotic order complexity for fill-in and operation count 
as nested dissection. The analysis is verified by showing exact match between analytical prediction and experimental measurement. The analysis 
motivates a peripheral preordering strategy for use with the popular multiple minimum degree (MMD) algorithm, and is shown to consistently 
reduce fill-in and operation count for regular grids.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Implicit curves are widely used in computer graphics because of their powerful features for modeling and their ability for general function description. The most popular rasterization techniques for implicit curves are space subdivision and curve 
tracking. In this paper we are introducing an efficient curve tracking algorithm that 
is also more robust then existing methods. We employ the Predictor-Corrector 
Method on the implicit function to get a very accurate curve approximation in a 
short time. Speedup is achieved by adapting the step size to the curvature. In addition, we provide mechanisms to detect and properly handle bifurcation points, 
where the curve intersects itself. Finally, the algorithm allows the user to trade-off 
accuracy for speed and vice a versa. We conclude by providing examples that dem-onstrate the capabilities of our algorithm.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper identifies performance degradation in wormhole routed k-ary n-cube networks due 
to limited number of router-to-processor consumption channels at each node. Many recent research 
in wormhole routing have advocated the advantages of adaptive routing and virtual channel flow 
control schemes to deliver better network performance. This paper indicates that the advantages 
associated with these schemes can not be realized with limited consumption capacity. To alleviate 
such performance bottleneck, a new network interface design using multiple consumption channels 
is proposed. To match virtual multiplexing on network channels, we also propose each consumption 
channel to support multiple virtual consumption channels. The impact of message arrival rate at 
a node on the required number of consumption channel is studied analytically. It is shown that 
wormhole networks with higher routing adaptivity, dimensionality, degree of hot-spot traffic, and 
number of virtual lanes have to take advantage of multiple consumption channels to deliver better 
performance. The interplay between system topology, routing algorithm, number of virtual lanes, 
messaging overheads, and communication traffic is studied through simulation to derive the effective 
number of consumption channels required in a system. Using the on-going technological trend, it is 
shown that wormhole-routed systems can use up to 2-4 consumption channels per node to deliver 
better system performance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: How do we formally specify the relation between a base class and a 
derived class? This question has two parts, a syntactic one, and a semantic one. 
The syntactic part is of course the easier of the two and the answer to that part is 
the standard contra/co- variance requirement on the arguments and result of any 
base class method redefined in the derived class. Our concern in the current paper 
is with the semantic part of the question, i.e., how do we specify the behavioral 
relation between the base class and the derived class? We show that the standard 
answer -which is the semantic counterpart of contra/co-variance- is too rigid, and 
does not allow some natural and common forms of inheritance. We then propose a 
more flexible way to specify the relation, and show how different types of behavioral relations between base classes and derived classes may be specified using our 
notation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
ATM Forum specifies public key cryptography to be the default ATM authentication mechanism and directory services like X.509 to be the infrastructure for public 
key distribution and certification. Authenticated signaling, widely acknowledged 
as a necessary security feature of ATM network, requires the signaling message to 
be authenticated with a digital signature signed by the private key of the calling 
party. To verify the digital signature, the called party needs to obtain the public 
key of the calling party and a proof of the calling party's ownership to that public 
key. In X.509, the standard form of such a proof is a chain of public key certificates, called the certificate path between two parties. Certificate exchange protocol 
(CEP), proposed by ATM Forum, requires that another bi-directional connection 
be established between two parties to exchange public keys and certificate paths 
before an authenticated connection can be set up, which is not an ideal approach. 
We propose an algorithm which is embedded into ATM routing protocols to generate a certificate path inside a signaling message on-the-fly as the signaling message 
travels through the ATM network. In this approach, all that a calling party needs 
to know for authentication purpose is its own public key certificate and the ATM 
network builds the rest of the certificate path for it. Related issues like distribution 
of public key certificates and optimization of CA hierarchy are also addressed in 
this paper.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A neural network approach to the classic 
inverted pendulum task is presented. This task is the 
task of keeping a rigid pole, hinged to a cart and free 
to fall in a plane, in a roughly vertical orientation by 
moving the cart horizontally in the plane while keeping the cart within some maximum distance of its 
starting position. This task constitutes a difficult control problem if the parameters of the cart-pole system 
are not known precisely or are variable. It also forms 
the basis of an even more complex control-learning 
problem if the controller must learn the proper actions 
for successfully balancing the pole given only the current state of the system and a failure signal when the 
pole angle from the vertical becomes too great or the 
cart exceeds one of the boundaries placed on its position. 
The approach presented is demonstrated to 
be effective for the real-time control of a small, self-contained mini-robot, specially outfitted for the task. 
Origins and details of the learning scheme, specifics 
of the mini-robot hardware, and results of actual 
learning trials are presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
According to space-based theory, visual attention is limited to a local region in space 
called the attentional field. Visual information within the attentional field is enhanced 
for further processing while information outside is suppressed. There is evidence that 
enhancement and suppression are achieved with dynamic weighting of network activity. 
This paper discusses a neural network that generates the appropriate weights, called the 
attentional spotlight, given the size and the position of the intended attentional field. 
The network has three layers. A shunting feedback network serves as the output layer 
and performs a critical task which cannot be accomplished by feedforward networks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of concurrent mapping and localization has received considerable attention in the mobile robotics community. With few exceptions, existing approaches can largely be 
grouped into two distinct paradigms: topological and metric. 
This paper proposes a method that integrates both paradigms. 
It poses the mapping problem as a statistical maximum likelihood problem, and devises an efficient algorithm for search 
in likelihood space. Based on that, it presents an novel mapping algorithm that integrates two phases: a topological and a 
metric mapping phase. The topological mapping phase solves a 
global position alignment problem between potentially indistinguishable, significant places. The subsequent metric mapping 
phase produces a fine-grained metric map of the environment 
in floating-point resolution. Experimental results in cyclic environments of sizes up to 80 by 25 meters demonstrate the 
appropriateness of this approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A simple polygon P is said to have a Hamilitonian Triangulation if it has a triangulation 
whose dual graph contains a Hamiltonian path. Such triangulations are useful in fast 
rendering engines in Computer Graphics. Arkin et al. [AHMS] observed that a polygon 
has a Hamiltonian triangulation if and only if it is Discretely Straight Walkable, a concept 
that is a discrete version of Straight Walkability concept as introduced by Icking and Klein 
[IK]. Using this characterization, Arkin et al. also showed an algorithm to recognize such 
polygons in time that is linear in the size of the visibility polygon of the given polygon P . 
The size of the visbility polygon of P could be quadratic in the size of P and hence their 
algorithm could be very inefficient even for nearly convex polygons. 
We give a new characterization of polygons with Hamiltonian triangulations. We use 
this characterization to present the following algorithms: 
* An O(n log n)-time algorithm to recognize polygons with a Hamiltonian triangulation. 
* An O(n log n)-time algorithm to construct such a triangulation. 
* Given vertices p and q on a simple polygon, an O(n)-time algorithm to determine 
whether the polygon is discretely straight walkable with respect to the two vertices. 
* An O(n log n)-time algorithm to list out all pairs of points on a simple polygon with 
respect to which the polygon is discretely straight walkable.  </abstract>

The V -cycle of the wavelet variation of the "Frequency decomposition multigrid method" of Hackbusch [Numer. Math., 56, pp. 
229-245, 1989] is considered. 
It is shown that its convergence speed is not affected by the presence of anisotropy provided that the corresponding coarse grid correction is damped sufficiently strong. Our analysis is based on properties 
of wavelet packets which are supplied and proved. 
Numerical approximations to the speed of convergence illustrate 
the theoretical results.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
This paper discusses several current attempts to use acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation for modeling 
physical phenomena and the role that wavelet analysis is playing in these efforts. The first problem involves recent 
application of wavelets to computational fluid dynamics. The second problem involves geophysical modeling of the 
ocean floor, using acoustic waves, and wavelets have recently been shown to play an important role here already. 
The third problem involves modeling of SAR radar images in the context of automatic target recognition efforts. 
The fourth problem is global illumination in computer graphics, i.e., simulation of reflected and absorbed light 
for everyday environments. The role of wavelets is more embryonic in these latter two areas, but there are some 
common principles in all of these modeling efforts, and the methodology of wavelets seems well suited to certain 
aspects of these problems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Computer security professionals and researchers do not have a history of sharing and analyzing computer 
vulnerability information. Scientists and engineers from older or more established fields have long understood 
that publicizing, analyzing, and learning from other people's mistakes is essential to the stepwise refinement 
of complex systems. Computer scientists, however, have not followed suit. Programmers reinvent classical 
programming mistakes, contributing to the reappearance of known vulnerabilities. 
In the recent past, computer systems have come to be a part of critical systems that have a direct effect 
on the safety and well-being of human beings and hence we must have lower tolerance for software failures. 
In the dissertation I will attempt to show that computer vulnerability information presents important 
regularities and these can be detected, and possibly visualized, providing important insight about the reason 
of their prevalence and existence. The information derived from these observations could be used to improve on 
all phases of the development of software systems, as could be in the design, development, debugging, testing 
and maintenance of complex computer systems that must implement a set of policies defined by security 
analysis. 
A significant portion of the work that must be performed will concentrate on the development of classifications and taxonomies that will permit the visualization and analysis of computer vulnerability information. 
I hope that these classifications and taxonomies applied to a collection of vulnerabilities will provide a set 
of features whose analysis will show that there are clear statistical clusterings and patterns caused because 
developers and programmers are not learning from each others mistakes. This analysis may be performed by 
applying statistical analysis and knowledge discovery tools.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Many operating systems have long had pseudo-teletypes, inter-process 
communication channels that provide terminal semantics on one end, 
and a smart server program on the other. We describe an analogous 
concept, pseudo-network drivers. One end of the driver appears to be 
a real network device, with the appropriate interface and semantics; 
data written to it goes to a program, however, rather than to a physical 
medium. Using this and some auxiliary mechanisms, we present a 
variety of applications, including system test, network monitoring, 
dial-up TCP/IP, and ways to both improve and subvert network 
security. Most notably, we show how pseudo-network devices can be 
used to create virtual networks and to provide encrypted 
communications capability. We describe two implementations, one 
using a conventional driver for socket-based systems, and one using 
stream pipes for System V.  </abstract>

<title> MPI: A Message Passing Interface 
The MPI Forum  </title>
<abstract> This paper presents an overview of mpi, a proposed 
standard message passing interface for MIMD distributed memory concurrent computers. The design 
of mpi has been a collective effort involving researchers 
in the United States and Europe from many organizations and institutions. mpi includes point-to-point 
and collective communication routines, as well as support for process groups, communication contexts, and 
application topologies. While making use of new ideas 
where appropriate, the mpi standard is based largely 
on current practice.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In 1972, Reynolds outlined a general method for eliminating functional arguments known as defunctionalization. The 
idea underlying defunctionalization is encoding functional 
values as first-order data, and then to realized the applications of the encoded function via an apply function. Although this process is simple enough, problems arise when 
defunctionalization is used in a polymorphic language. In 
such a language, a functional argument of a higher-order 
function can take different type instances in different applications. As a consequence, its associated apply function can 
be untypable in the soucre language. In the paper we present 
a defunctionalization transformation which preserves typa-bility. Moreover, the transformation imposes no restriction 
on functional arguments of recursive functions, and it handles functions as results as well as functions encapsulated in 
constructors or tuples. The key to this success is the use 
of type information in the defunctionalization transformation. Run-time characteristics are preserved by defunction-alization; hence, there is no performance improvement coming from the transformation itself. However closures need 
not be implemented to compile the transformed program. 
Since the defunctionalization is driven by type information, 
it can also easily perform a specialization of higher-order 
functions with respect to the values of their functional arguments, hence gaining a real run-time improvement of the 
transformed program.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Reactive systems respond to concurrent, possibly unsynchronized streams of input events. Programming 
reactive systems is challenging without language support for event-triggered actions. It is even more 
challenging to reason about reactive systems. This paper explores a new conceptual basis for applying 
functional programming techniques to the design and formal verification of reactive systems. The 
mathematical foundation for this approach is based upon signature coalgebras and derived proof rules 
for coinduction. The concepts are illustrated with an example that has been used with the language 
Esterel.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Recent advances in the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) have enabled a new approach to supporting mobile users: location independent 
naming. In this approach, machines use the same hostname from any internet location, but use an 
IP address that corresponds to their current location. We describe a protocol that implements 
location independent naming for nomadic computers, i.e., machines that do not need transparent 
mobility. Our protocol allows hosts to move across security domains, uses existing protocols, and 
preserves existing trust relationships. Therefore, it preserves the performance and security of 
normal IP for nomadic computers at the expense of not providing the transparent mobility of 
Mobile IP. We contend that this is a reasonable tradeoff for nomadic computing.

<abstract> Abstract 
We give a review of basic statistical and neural techniques for classification. Statistical techniques are based on the idea of estimating class-conditional likelihoods and using Bayes rule 
to convert these to posterior class probabilities whereas neural techniques estimate directly the 
posteriors. Statistical techniques include (i) Parametric (Gaussian) Bayes classifiers, (ii) Non-parametric kernel-based density estimators like k-nearest neighbor and Parzen windows, and 
(iii) mixtures of (Gaussian) densities (a special case of which is the Learning Vector Quantization). As neural classifiers, we include simple perceptrons and multilayer perceptrons with 
sigmoid and Gaussian hidden units. The neural and statistical techniques are quite similar in 
many respects and many approaches have been discovered independently twice, once in 1960s 
by statisticians and once in 1980s by the neural network researchers. One of the aims of this article is to make this link more apparent. We also discuss two, most popular, pattern recognition 
applications: Optical character recognition and speech recognition. Though they seem different, 
in many respects, the two applications are similar and in the past, almost the same techniques 
have been applied for their implementation. We implement the well known statistical and neural 
classification techniques for two datasets of these applications and compare them in terms of 
generalization accuracy, memory requirement and learning time. We especially advise to take 
into account statistics of the sample even if a neural classifier is to be used. The similarity 
between statistical and neural techniques is greater than generally agreed and simple statistical 
methods like k-NN perform generally quite well and much of the functionality of neural networks like distributed parallel computation can be obtained by such methods without requiring 
complicated computation and precise error minimization procedures.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We define a standard of effectiveness for a database calculus 
relative to a query language. Effectiveness judges suitability 
to serve as a processing framework for the query language, 
and comprises aspects of coverage, manipulability and 
efficient evaluation. We present the monoid calculus, and 
argue its effectiveness for object-oriented query languages, 
exemplified by OQL of ODMG-93. The monoid calculus 
readily captures such features as multiple collection types, 
aggregations, arbitrary composition of type constructors and 
nested query expressions. We also show how to extend 
the monoid calculus to deal with vectors and arrays in 
more expressive ways than current query languages do, and 
illustrate how it can handle identity and updates.  </abstract>

<keyword> Keywords: Register Allocation, Continuation-passing Style, Procedure Call  </keyword>
<abstract> Abstract. Continuation-passing style (CPS) is a good abstract representation to use 
for compilation and optimization: it has a clean semantics and is easily manipulated. 
We examine how CPS expresses the saving and restoring of registers in source-language 
procedure calls. In most CPS-based compilers, the context of the calling procedure is 
saved in a "continuation closure"|a single variable that is passed as an argument to the 
function being called. This closure is a record containing bindings of all the free variables 
of the continuation; that is, registers that hold values needed by the caller "after the call" 
are written to memory in the closure, and fetched back after the call. 
Consider the procedure-call mechanisms used by conventional compilers. In particular, 
registers holding values needed after the call must be saved and later restored. The 
responsibility for saving registers can lie with the caller (a "caller-saves" convention) 
or with the called function ("callee-saves"). In practice, to optimize memory traffic, 
compilers find it useful to have some caller-saves registers and some callee-saves. 
"Conventional" CPS-based compilers that pass a pointer to a record containing all 
the variables needed after the call (i.e., the continuation closure), are using a caller-saves 
convention. We explain how to express callee-save registers in Continuation-Passing 
Style, and give measurements showing the resulting improvement in execution time.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose several new techniques for resource management in a replicated object server. By coordinating cache 
and disk usage among the replicas, these techniques increase throughput and reduce fetch latency. Cache splitting 
speeds up fetches by avoiding redundant cache entries, effectively increasing the cache size. Coordinated writing 
coordinates disk writes to ensure that one replica is always 
available to service fetches. We investigate the performance 
of a replicated server using these techniques, and we present 
simulation results showing that these techniques provide 
substantial performance improvements across a variety of 
workloads.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A digraph D is called a quasi-transitive digraph (QTD) if for any 
triple x; ; of distinct vertices of D such that (x; ) and (; ) are 
arcs of D there is at least one arc from x to or from to x. Solving 
a conjecture by J. Bang-Jensen and J. Huang (J. Graph Theory, to 
appear), G. Gutin (Australas. J. Combin., to appear) described polynomial algorithms for finding a Hamiltonian cycle and a Hamiltonian 
path (if it exists) in a QTD. The approach taken in that paper cannot 
be used to find a longest path or cycle in polynomial time. We present 
a principally new approach that leads to polynomial algorithms for 
finding vertex heaviest paths and cycles in QTD's with non-negative 
weights on the vertices. This, in particular, provides an answer to a 
question by N. Alon on longest paths and cycles in QTD's.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes several of our experiences with a real-time scheduler. Using a robot control application program, we motivate the importance of supporting multiple schedulers within the same application 
program. We demonstrate the utility of speculative task execution in dynamic real-time systems, and describe the implementation of a scheduler for performing speculative execution and recovery. We show that 
existing real-time scheduler interfaces have scope for improvement, especially when scheduling latency must 
be low and when multiple schedulers used by a single application must co-exist on a single processor. A new 
scheduler interface is specified and its basic costs are evaluated experimentally. Preliminary measurements on 
a KSR-1 machine are quoted. The measurements demonstrate how the execution times of temporal queries 
may be reduced by use of access structures to scheduler data structures. Finally, there are several overheads 
associated with speculative execution, and multiple schedulers in a single application. We consider the problem of on-line reconfiguration of the several overheads associated with the speculative-execution paradigm 
for optimal performance in the face of these overheads. Initial performance measurements of the PORTS 
scheduler indicate that it is possible to perform real-time scheduling with latencies approximating those of 
proposed specialized scheduling co-processors.  </abstract>

<title> Core Selection Methods for 
Multicast Routing  </title>

 </author>
<pubnum> GIT-CC-95/15 
 </pubnum>
<abstract> Abstract 
Multicast routing is an important topic of both theoretical and practical 
interest. Some recently-proposed multicast routing algorithms involve the 
designation of one or more network nodes as the "center" of the routing 
tree for each multicast group address. The choice of this designated router 
(which we refer to as the "core") influences the shape of the multicast routing 
tree, and thus influences performance of the routing scheme. In this paper we 
investigate the relationship between the choice of core and three performance 
measures. Specifically, we compare various methods of selecting a core with 
respect to their effect on bandwidth, delay, and traffic concentration. We 
conclude that simple methods are adequate for widely distributed groups, 
but that the addition of group information can be leveraged to improve 
performance especially when the group is small or exhibits a high degree 
of locality. We also conclude that core choice has a significant impact on 
traffic concentration, in fact traffic concentration effects can be ameliorated 
by appropriate core choice policies.  </abstract>

<author> Daryl T. Lawton Warren F. Gardner  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes a general architecture for an interactive model-based vision system. A 
human specifies a limited amount of information which establishes a context for autonomous interpretation of images. Object models are described by constraints specifying necessary geometrical 
properties and relationships between objects. The use of constraints allows for flexible object in-stantiation. A user can indicate an object in a scene and this directs perceptual processing routines 
as well as constraining future object instantiations. This interactive model-based concept has been 
applied to the domain of vehicle tracking, and this paper concludes with several processing examples 
from this domain.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Using the Trellis human/computer interaction model as an implementation vehicle, we demonstrate 
how to use concurrency-supporting hypertext to provide visual displays of the execution flows through 
a parallel Lisp program. In addition to displays, the hypertext interface allows injection of control 
flow into an otherwise functional computation, and therefore provides reader control over the order of 
evaluation of expressions. The resulting system, termed Trellis, can be thought of as a concurrent control 
flow browser for composing functional computations, providing a visual implementation of kernel-control 
decomposition. The advantages of Trellis are ease of exploring program side effects; ease of debugging 
parallel code; aid in teaching functional languages; and the ability to construct hypertext documents 
that have parallel execution semantics and flexible browsing behaviors.

<abstract> Computer networks hold the potential to coordinate the activities of multiple machines so that their combined computational abilities can be applied to solving a single problem. Several methods have been developed over the years to 
harness the power of networked systems for solving certain classes of problems. One such class of problems is the distributed producer/consumer problem, in which a set of producer processes supply items to a set of consumer processes. Each 
of the processes involved resides on a different machine, with the machines being connected by a network and the processes communicating via message passing. The problem, then, is how to coordinate the activities of the producers and consumers so that an acceptable level of throughput can be maintained with a minimal amount of overhead. This paper 
presents a simple solution to the distributed producer/consumer problem. This solution, which is based upon the notion of 
a distributed pool, is described in detail and its performance analyzed. As the analysis shows, the distributed pools algorithm presented herein is a simple, efficient solution to the distributed producer/consumer problem, and is capable of better than 90% efficiency under common conditions. Its major failing is that it needs the production rates of the producers 
to be reasonably similar.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A new, efficient selection predicate indexing scheme for active database systems is introduced. 
The selection predicate index proposed uses an interval index on an attribute of a relation or 
object collection when one or more rule condition clauses are defined on that attribute. The 
selection predicate index uses a new type of interval index called the interval skip list (IS-list). 
The IS-list is designed to allow efficient retrieval of all intervals that overlap a point, while allowing 
dynamic insertion and deletion of intervals. IS-list algorithms are described in detail. The IS-list 
allows efficient on-line searches, insertions, and deletions, yet is much simpler to implement than 
other comparable interval index data structures such as the priority search tree and balanced 
interval binary search tree (IBS-tree). IS-lists require only one third as much code to implement 
as balanced IBS-trees. The combination of simplicity, performance, and dynamic updateability 
of the IS-list is unmatched by any other interval index data structure. This makes the IS-list a 
good interval index structure for implementation in an active database predicate index.   </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Shape modeling is an important constituent of computer vision as well as computer graphics 
research. Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper 
presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of 
existing methods, and overcomes some of their limitations. Our techniques can be applied to 
model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to 
situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance 
of our model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the 
ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed 
by Osher and Sethian to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent 
speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient 
field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a 
"Hamilton-Jacobi" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular 
level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of 
object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying 
upwind finite difference schemes. We present a variety of ways of computing evolving front, 
including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the 
scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low 
contrast medical images.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The role of the systems analyst in the implementation process has changed 
dramatically in recent times because of changes to organisational boundaries, the 
need to align IT with business objectives and the complexity of the systems now 
required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing 
environment and being involved in multi-organisational structures. Establishing 
strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding 
of the implementation process. Implementation is concerned with behavioural 
phenomena since people are involved from the inception of the idea, as well as 
being involved in the development process. They are also affected by the changes 
which the new system brings to the organisation. The research is attempting to 
understand the critical factors associated with the implementation process and 
consequently develop an appropriate model.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Two-way authentication methods are inefficient when used to authenticate multiple users who wish to communicate securely with each other. M-way, also called conference authentication, is designed to efficiently authenticate many users and distribute a secure common conference key. Unfortunately, few if any conference 
authentication schemes have been developed and/or performance tested in a real distributed system. This report 
attempts to rectify this problem. Specifically, it presents the performance of both a star and a ring-based conference authentication scheme that has been developed for the RHODOS distributed operating system. As with most 
systems, RHODOS does not have any special hardware, thus, a software based solution is utilised. This report 
also attempts to shed some light upon how viable and secure a conference authentication scheme would be when 
used in a distributed system.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The appearance of an object or a face changes continuously as the observer 
moves through the environment or as a face changes expression or pose. Recognizing an object or a face despite these image changes is a challenging problem 
for computer vision systems, yet we perform the task quickly and easily. This 
simulation investigates the ability of an unsupervised learning mechanism to 
acquire representations that are tolerant to such changes in the image. The 
learning mechanism finds these representations by capturing temporal relationships between 2-D patterns. Previous models of temporal association learning 
have used idealized input representations. The input to this model consists of 
graylevel images of faces. A two-layer network learned face representations that 
incorporated changes of pose up to 30 ffi . A second network learned representations that were independent of facial expression.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The game of Go has a high branching factor that defeats the tree 
search approach used in computer chess, and long-range spa-tiotemporal interactions that make position evaluation extremely 
difficult. Development of conventional Go programs is hampered 
by their knowledge-intensive nature. We demonstrate a viable 
alternative by training networks to evaluate Go positions via temporal difference (TD) learning. 
Our approach is based on network architectures that reflect the 
spatial organization of both input and reinforcement signals on 
the Go board, and training protocols that provide exposure to 
competent (though unlabelled) play. These techniques yield far 
better performance than undifferentiated networks trained by self-play alone. A network with less than 500 weights learned within 
3,000 games of 9x9 Go a position evaluation function that enables 
a primitive one-ply search to defeat a commercial Go program at 
a low playing level.  </abstract>

<title> Displaying 3D Images: Algorithms for 
Single Image Random Dot Stereograms  </title>
<author> Harold W. Thimbleby, Stuart Inglis, and Ian H. Witten *  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes how to generate a single image which, when viewed in the 
appropriate way, appears to the brain as a 3D scene. The image is a stereogram composed 
of seemingly random dots. A new, simple and symmetric algorithm for generating such 
images from a solid model is given, along with the design parameters and their influence 
on the display. The algorithm improves on previously-described ones in several ways: it 
is symmetric and hence free from directional (right-to-left or left-to-right) bias, it corrects 
a slight distortion in the rendering of depth, it removes hidden parts of surfaces, and it 
also eliminates a type of artifact that we call an echo. 
Random dot stereograms have one remaining problem: difficulty of initial viewing. If 
a computer screen rather than paper is used for output, the problem can be ameliorated by 
shimmering, or time-multiplexing of pixel values. We also describe a simple 
computational technique for determining what is present in a stereogram so that, if 
viewing is difficult, one can ascertain what to look for.  </abstract>

<title> Constructing a Configurable Group RPC Service  </title>

<address> Tucson, AZ 85721, USA  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
Current Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services implement a variety of semantics, with many of the differences 
related to how communication and server failures are handled. The list increases even more when considering group 
RPC, a variant of RPC often used for fault-tolerance where 
an invocation is sent to a group of servers rather than one. 
This paper presents an approach to constructing group 
RPC in which a single configurable system is used to build 
different variants of the service. The approach is based on 
implementing each property as a separate software module 
called a micro-protocol, and then configuring the micro-protocols needed to implement the desired service together 
using a software framework based on the x-kernel. The 
properties of point-to-point and group RPC are identified 
and classified, and the general execution model described. 
An example consisting of a modular implementation of a 
group RPC service is given to illustrate the approach. Dependency issues that restrict configurability are also addressed.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The NASA Numerical Propulsion System Simulation 
(NPSS) project is exploring the use of computer simulation 
to facilitate the design of new jet engines. Several key issues 
raised in this research are being examined in an NPSS-related research project: zooming, monitoring and control, 
and support for heterogeneity. The design of a simulation 
executive that addresses each of these issues is described. 
In this work, the strategy of zooming, which allows codes 
that model at different levels of fidelity to be integrated 
within a single simulation, is applied to the fan component 
of a turbofan propulsion system. A prototype monitoring 
and control system has been designed for this simulation to 
support experimentation with expert system techniques for 
active control of the simulation. An interconnection system 
provides a transparent means of connecting the heterogeneous systems that comprise the prototype.  </abstract>

manual pages, NBT for files in a hierarchical file system, and FoSel for 
bitmap fonts. Each exploits the large-scale natural organization of data 
and the fine-grained structure of each datum with a graphical user interface to provide a powerful yet intuitive tool. The lessons learned in implementing the browsers point to general principles that should guide the 
design of all information browsers.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
This paper evaluates several hardware platforms and operating systems using a set of benchmarks

overall conclusion is that operating system performance is not improving at the same rate as the 
base speed of the underlying hardware. The most obvious ways to remedy this situation are to 
improve memory bandwidth and reduce operating systems' tendency to wait for disk operations to

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes the application of Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming (PDGP) to the problem of inducing programs for natural language processing. 
PDGP is a new form of Genetic Programming (GP) which is suitable for the development of programs with a high degree of parallelism and an efficient and effective 
reuse of partial results. Programs are represented in PDGP as graphs with nodes 
representing functions and terminals, and links representing the flow of control and 
results. PDGP allows the exploration of a large space of possible programs including standard tree-like programs, logic networks, neural networks, finite state 
automata, Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs), etc. The paper describes the 
representations, the operators and the interpreters used in PDGP, and illustrates 
its behaviour on the problem of inducing RTN-based recognisers for natural lan 
guage from positive and negative examples.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In artificial evolution individuals which perform as their parents are usually rewarded identically 
to their parents. We note that Nature is more dynamic and there may be a penalty to pay for doing 
the same thing as your parents. We report two sets of experiments where static fitness functions 
are firstly augmented by a penalty for unchanged offspring and secondly the static fitness case 
is replaced by randomly generated dynamic test cases. We conclude genetic programming, when 
evolving artificial ant control programs, is surprisingly little effected by large penalties and program 
growth is observed in all our experiments.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail is used as an example 
program search space. Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics 
often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search 
space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep 
valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult for hill climbing algorithms. 
Analysis of the program search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive 
and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above 
average fitness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed representation 
from small building blocks of above average fitness. These suggest the Ant problem is difficult for 
Genetic Algorithms. 
Random sampling of the program search space suggests on average the density of global optima 
changes only slowly with program size but the density of neutral networks linking points of the same 
fitness grows approximately linearly with program length. This is part of the cause of bloat. 
Previously reported genetic programming, simulated annealing and hill climbing performance is 
shown not to be much better than random search on the Ant problem.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we present the GP-Music System, an interactive system which allows users to evolve short musical sequences 
using interactive genetic programming, and its extensions aimed at making the system fully automated. The basic GP-system works by using a genetic programming algorithm, a small set of functions for creating musical sequences, and a user 
interface which allows the user to rate individual sequences. With this user interactive technique it was possible to generate 
pleasant tunes over runs of 20 individuals over 10 generations. As the user is the bottleneck in interactive systems, the 
system takes rating data from a users run and uses it to train a neural network based automatic rater, or auto rater, which 
can replace the user in bigger runs. Using this auto rater we were able to make runs of up to 50 generations with 500 
individuals per generation. The best of run pieces generated by the auto raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as 
nice as those generated in user interactive runs.  </abstract>

We show how to model energy consumption based on 
the high-level language specification. This model is independent of voltage and timing considerations. We 
apply this model to memory design. We show first 
how to dimension a memory array, and how to break 
up this memory array into smaller arrays to minimize 
the energy per access. We then show how to use cache 
memory and pre-fetch mechanisms to further reduce 
energy per access.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. A critical challenge faced by the developer of a software system is to understand whether the system's components correctly integrate. While type theory has provided substantial help in detecting and 
preventing errors in mismatched static properties, much work remains 
in the area of dynamics. In particular, components make assumptions 
about their behavioral interaction with other components, but currently 
we have only limited ways in which to state those assumptions and to 
analyze those assumptions for correctness. 
We have begun to formulate a method that addresses this problem. The 
method operates at the architectural level so that behavioral integration 
errors, such as deadlock, can be revealed early in development. For each 
component, a specification is given both of its own interaction behavior 
and of the assumptions that it makes about the interaction behavior of 
the external context in which it expects to operate. We have defined an 
algorithm that, given such specifications for a set of components, performs "adequacy" checks between the component context assumptions 
and the component interaction behaviors. A configuration of a system is 
possible if and only if a successful way of "matching" actual behaviors 
with assumptions can be found. In effect, we are extending the usual no 
tion of type checking to include the checking of behavioral compatibility.  </abstract>

This paper presents a method that can be used for

the Integrated System Model (ISM). The ISM is the result of merging the independent system views from all 
stakeholders at any given abstraction level. Formulation of this method was based on the real-world experience of developing a complex, high-technology medical 
product with critical time-to-market pressures. It has 
proven to be a practical approach to the evolution of 
requirements definition and provides a necessary link 
to the marketing aspect of a product.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Software distribution is evolving from a physical media 
approach to one where it is practical and advantageous to 
leverage the connectivity of networks. Network distribution of software systems provides timeliness and continuity 
of evolution not possible with physical media distribution 
methods. To support network-based software distribution, 
companies and organizations such as Microsoft, Marimba, 
and the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) are 
strengthening their efforts to package software systems in 
a way that is conducive to network distribution and management. The result of these efforts has led to the creation 
of software description languages and schema such as the 
Open Software Description format created by Microsoft and 
Marimba and the Management Information Format created 
by DMTF. While these efforts are steps in the right direction, they do not address deployment issues in a complete 
and systematic fashion. The contribution of this paper is to 
evaluate these leading software description technologies.  </abstract>

<title> Global Optimization Methods for Protein Folding Problems  </title>
<author> Richard H. Byrd, Elizabeth Eskow, Andre van der Hoek, Robert B. 
Schnabel, Chung-Shang Shao, and Zhihong Zou  </author>
<abstract> Abstract. The problem of finding the naturally occurring structure of a protein is believed to correspond to minimizing the free, or potential, energy of 
the protein. This is generally a very difficult global optimization problem, with 
a large number of parameters and a huge number of local minimizers including many with function values near that of the global minimizer. This paper 
presents a new global optimization method for such problems. The method 
consists of an initial phase that locates some reasonably low local minimizers of 
the energy function, followed by the main phase that progresses from the best 
current local minimizers to even lower local minimizers. The method combines 
portions that work on small subsets of the parameters, including small-scale 
global optimizations using stochastic methods, with local minimizations involving all the parameters. In computational tests on the protein polyalanine 
with up to 58 amino acids (116 internal parameters), the method appears to 
be very successful in finding the lowest energy structures. The largest case 
is particularly significant because the lowest energy structures that are found 
include ones that exhibit interesting tertiary as opposed to just secondary 
structure.  </abstract>

In this position paper we raise the question of whether Configuration Management (CM) 
research has a future. The new standard in CM systems|typified by commercial products 
such as Adele, ADC, ClearCase, Continuus/CM, and CCC/Harvest|largely satisfies the CM 
functionality requirements posed by Dart. This implies that research in the area of CM is either 
unnecessary or that we must find new challenges in CM on which to focus. We believe that 
these challenges indeed exist. Here we present some areas that we feel are good opportunities 
for new or continued CM research, and therefore conclude that CM research does have a future.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we propose a new framework for 
studying Markov decision processes (MDPs), 
based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The 
goal of learning in MDPs is to find a policy 
that yields the maximum expected return over 
time. In choosing policies, agents must therefore weigh the prospects of short-term versus 
long-term gains. We study a simple MDP in 
which the agent must constantly decide between exploratory jumps and local reward mining in state space. The number of policies to 
choose from grows exponentially with the size 
of the state space, N . We view the expected returns as defining an energy landscape over policy space. Methods from statistical mechanics 
are used to analyze this landscape in the thermodynamic limit N ! 1. We calculate the 
overall distribution of expected returns, as well 
as the distribution of returns for policies at a 
fixed Hamming distance from the optimal one. 
We briefly discuss the problem of learning optimal policies from empirical estimates of the 
expected return. As a first step, we relate our 
findings for the entropy to the limit of high-temperature learning. Numerical simulations 
support the theoretical results.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
I present a modular network architecture and a learning algorithm based 
on incremental dynamic programming that allows a single learning agent 
to learn to solve multiple Markovian decision tasks (MDTs) with significant transfer of learning across the tasks. I consider a class of MDTs, 
called composite tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of 
simpler, elemental MDTs. The architecture is trained on a set of composite and elemental MDTs. The temporal structure of a composite task is 
assumed to be unknown and the architecture learns to produce a temporal decomposition. It is shown that under certain conditions the solution 
of a composite MDT can be constructed by computationally inexpensive

<abstract> Abstract 
A novel approach to constant-magnification imaging is proposed. Magnification variations due to 
changes in focus setting pose problems for important 
vision techniques, such as, depth from defocus. It 
is shown that magnification of a conventional lens 
can be made invariant to defocus by simply adding 
an aperture at an analytically derived location. The 
resulting optical configuration is called "telecentric." 
It is shown that most commercially available lenses 
can be turned into telecentric ones. The procedure 
for calculating the position of the additional aperture 
and a detailed analysis of the photometric and geometric properties of telecentric lenses are discussed. 
The magnification invariance of telecentric optics and 
its application to the problem of depth from defocus 
are experimentally demonstrated in [ Watanabe and 
Nayar-1995 ] . The proposed optics was found to result in significantly improved depth maps than those 
obtained using a conventional lens.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
There is increasing interest in the recovery of generalized cylinders (GCs) with curved spines. However, 
existing formulations of such GCs, for example those 
based on the Frenet-Serret frame or the tube model, 
suffer serious drawbacks: discontinuities, a lack of expressive power, "narrowing" in the plane normal to 
the spine, non-intuitive twisting behavior, and/or off-axis nonorthogonality of their local coordinate systems. 
We discuss some of the problems associated with the 
non-orthogonality of the coordinate system based on 
the Frenet-Serret frame. This non-orthogonality is induced by torsion effects and we show how to correct for 
it. We then introduce a new model, the extruded GC 
(EGC) model, which overcomes all the problems mentioned above. For complex axes, the EGC model is also 
simpler to understand and use than existing models. 
The EGC model is further extended by including local surface deformations. Recovery of the deformable 
EGC via a physically-motivated paradigm is demonstrated on pre-segmented data from a human carotid 
artery.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Let F be a class of functions defined on a d-dimensional domain. Our task is 
to compute H m -norm "-approximations to solutions of 2mth-order elliptic boundary-value 
problems Lu = f for a fixed L and for f 2 F . We assume that the only information we 
can compute about f 2 F is the value of a finite number of continuous linear functionals 
of f, each evaluation having cost c(d). Previous work has assumed that F was the unit 
ball of a Sobolev space H r of fixed smoothness r, and it was found that the complexity of 
computing an "-approximation was comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(1=") d=(r+m) ). Since the exponent 
of 1=" depends on d, we see that the problem is intractable in 1=" for any such F of fixed 
smoothness r. In this paper, we ask whether we can break intractability by letting F be the 
unit ball of a space of infinite smoothness. To be specific, we let F be the unit ball of a 
Hardy space of analytic functions defined over a complex d-dimensional ball of radius greater 
than one. We then show that the problem is tractable in 1=". More precisely, we prove that 
comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ), where the fi-constant depends on d. Since for any p &gt; 0, there 
is a function K() such that comp("; d) c(d)K(d)(1=") p for sufficiently small ", we see that 
the problem is tractable, with (minimal) exponent 0. Furthermore, we show how to construct 
a finite element p-method (in the sense of Babuska) that can compute an "-approximation 
with cost fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ). Hence this finite element method is a nearly optimal complexity 
algorithm for d-dimensional elliptic problems with analytic data.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Expert Databases are environments that support the processing of rule programs against a disk resident database. 
They occupy a position intermediate between active and deductive databases, with respect to the level of abstraction 
of the underlying rule language. The operational semantics 
of the rule language influences the problem solving strategy, 
while the architecture of the processing environment determines efficiency and scalability. 
In this paper, we present elements of the PARADISER 
architecture and its kernel rule language, PARULEL. The 
PARADISER environment provides support for parallel and 
distributed evaluation of rule programs, as well as static 
and dynamic load balancing protocols that predictively 
balance a computation at runtime. This combination of 
features results in a scalable database rule and complex 
query processing architecture. We validate our claims by 
analyzing the performance of the system for two realistic 
test cases. In particular, we show how the performance of a 
parallel implementation of transitive closure is significantly 
improved by predictive dynamic load balancing.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present a multi-dimensional database model, 
which we believe can serve as a conceptual model 
for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)-based 
applications. Apart from providing the functionalities necessary for OLAP-based applications, the 
main feature of the model we propose is a clear 
separation between structural aspects and the contents. This separation of concerns allows us to define data manipulation languages in a reasonably 
simple, transparent way. In particular, we show 
that the data cube operator can be expressed easily. Concretely, we define an algebra and a calculus 
and show them to be equivalent. We conclude by 
comparing our approach to related work. 
The conceptual multi-dimensional database model 
developed here is orthogonal to its implementa 
tion, which is not a subject of the present paper.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We consider the family of lines that are area bisectors of a polygon (possibly with 
holes) in the plane. We say that two bisectors of a polygon P are combinatorially 
distinct if they induce different partitionings of the vertices of P . We derive an algebraic 
characterization of area bisectors. We then show that there are simple polygons with n 
vertices that have (n 2 ) combinatorially distinct area bisectors (matching the obvious 
upper bound), and present an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit 
representation of all the bisectors of a given polygon. Our study is motivated by the 
development of novel, flexible feeding devices for parts positioning and orienting. The 
question of determining all the bisectors of polygonal parts arises in connection with 
the development of efficient part positioning strategies when using these devices.  </abstract>

<title> Numerical conformal mapping using cross-ratios 
and Delaunay triangulation  </title>
<author> Tobin A. Driscoll Stephen A. Vavasis   </author>
<date> January 23, 1996  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a new algorithm for computing the Riemann mapping of the 
unit disk to a polygon, also known as the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. 
The new algorithm, CRDT, is based on cross-ratios of the prevertices, and also 
on cross-ratios of quadrilaterals in a Delaunay triangulation of the polygon. 
The CRDT algorithm produces an accurate representation of the Riemann 
mapping even in the presence of arbitrary long, thin regions in the polygon, 
unlike any previous conformal mapping algorithm. We believe that CRDT can 
never fail to converge to the correct Riemann mapping, but the correctness and 
convergence proof depend on conjectures that we have so far not been able to 
prove. We demonstrate convergence with computational experiments. 
The Riemann mapping has applications to problems in two-dimensional 
potential theory and to finite-difference mesh generation. We use CRDT to 
produce a mapping and solve a boundary value problem on long, thin regions 
for which no other algorithm can solve these problems.  </abstract>

<title> Asymptotically Tight Bounds for Performing 
BMMC Permutations on Parallel Disk Systems  </title>
<author> Thomas H. Cormen

<abstract> Abstract 
We give asymptotically equal lower and upper bounds for the number of parallel I/O operations required to perform bit-matrix-multiply/complement (BMMC) permutations on parallel 
disk systems. In a BMMC permutation on N records, where N is a power of 2, each (lg N )-bit 
source address x maps to a corresponding (lg N)-bit target address by the matrix equation 
= A x c, where matrix multiplication is performed over GF (2). The characteristic matrix A 
is (lg N )fi(lg N ) and nonsingular over GF (2). Under the Vitter-Shriver parallel-disk model with 
N records, D disks, B records per block, and M records of memory, we show a universal lower 
bound of  
BD 
1 + rank  
lg(M=B) 
parallel I/Os for performing a BMMC permutation, where  
is the lower left lg(N=B) fi lg B submatrix of the characteristic matrix. We also present an algo 
rithm that uses at most 2N 
BD 
rank  
lg(M=B) 
+ 2 
parallel I/Os, which asymptotically matches the 
lower bound and improves upon the BMMC and bit-permute/complement (BPC) algorithms in 
[4]. When rank is low, this method is an improvement over the general-permutation bound of 
fi 
N 
lg(N=B) 
We introduce a new subclass of BMMC permutations, called memoryload-dispersal (MLD) 
permutations, which can be performed in one pass. This subclass, which is used in the BMMC 
algorithm, extends the catalog of one-pass permutations appearing in [4]. 
Although many BMMC permutations of practical interest fall into subclasses that might be 
explicitly invoked within the source code, we show how to detect in at most N=BD+ 
l 
D 
parallel I/Os whether a given vector of target addresses specifies a BMMC permutation. Thus, 
one can determine efficiently at run time whether a permutation to be performed is BMMC and 
then avoid the general-permutation algorithm and save parallel I/Os by using our algorithm.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the amount of 
information available to our society. In particular, the amount of 
information available online through vast networks like the global 
Internet has been growing at a staggering rate. This growth rate has by far 
exceeded the rate of growth in network speeds, as has the number of 
individuals and organizations seeking access to this information. There is 
thus a motivation to find abstract methods of manipulating this online 
data in ways that both serve the needs of end users efficiently and use 
network resources intelligently. In lieu of a traditional clientserver model 
of information processing, which is both inflexible and potentially very 
inefficient, a Transportable Intelligent Agent system has the potential to 
achieve a more efficient and flexible network system. An intelligent agent 
is a program that models the information space for a user, and allows the 
user to specify how the information is to be processed. A transportable 
agent can suspend its execution, transport itself to a new location on a 
network, and resume execution at the new location. This is a particularly 
attractive model for both wireless and dialup networks where a user might 
not be able to maintain a permanent network connection, as well as for 
situations where the amount of information to be processed is large 
relative to the network bandwidth. Preliminary work in the field has 
shown that such agent systems are possible and deserve further study. 
This thesis describes a prototype transportable intelligent agent system that 
extends work already done in the field. Agents are written in a modified 
version of the Tcl programming language and transported using TCP/IP 
connections. Several simple examples demonstrate the properties of the 
system.  </abstract>

<abstract> Most current multiprocessor file systems are designed to use multiple disks 
in parallel, using the high aggregate bandwidth to meet the growing I/O 
requirements of parallel scientific applications. Many multiprocessor file 
systems provide applications with a conventional Unix-like interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks transparently. This interface conceals the parallelism within the file system, increasing the ease 
of programmability, but making it difficult or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use knowledge about their I/O needs 
to exploit that parallelism. In addition to providing an insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file systems are optimized for a different 
workload than they are being asked to support. We introduce Galley, a 
new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently support realistic 
scientific multiprocessor workloads. We discuss Galley's file structure and 
application interface, as well as the performance advantages offered by 
that interface.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents a new atomic commitment protocol, enhanced three phase commit 
(E3PC ), that always allows a quorum in the system to make progress. Previously suggested 
quorum-based protocols (e.g., the quorum-based three phase commit (3PC) [Ske82]) allow a 
quorum to make progress in case of one failure. If failures cascade, however, and the quorum 
in the system is "lost" (i.e., at a given time no quorum component exists), a quorum can later 
become connected and still remain blocked. With our protocol, a connected quorum never 
blocks. E3PC is based on the quorum-based 3PC [Ske82], and it does not require more time 
or communication than 3PC. We describe how this protocol can be exploited in a replicated 
database setting, making the database always available to a majority of the sites.  </abstract>

<title> Relating Comprehension and Production

<author> Michael Gasser  </author>
<affiliation> Indiana University  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
Most theories of language processing and acquisition make the assumption that 
perception and comprehension are related to production, but few have anything say 
about how. This paper describes a performance-oriented connectionist model of 
the acquisition of morphology in which production builds on representations which 
develop during the learning of word recognition. Using artificial language stimuli 
embodying simple suffixation, prefixation, and template rules, I demonstrate that 
the model generalizes to novel combinations of roots and inflections for both word 
recognition and production. I argue that the capacity of connectionist networks to 
develop intermediate distributed representations which not only enable the solving 
of the task at hand but also facilitate another task offers a plausible account of how 
comprehension and production come to share phonological knowledge as words are 
learned.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Data- and task-parallelism are two important parallel programming models. Object-oriented paradigm 
in parallelism provides a good way of abstracting out various aspects of computations and computing resources. Using an object-oriented language like C++, one can compose data and control representations 
into a single active object. 
We propose a thread model of parallelism that addresses both data and task parallelism. Computation 
and communication can be overlapped by suspending a thread of computation which is waiting for an 
event and running an eligible thread of computation in its place. Threads naturally subsume task-parallelism. Threads are encapsulated into thread objects may be grouped into rope objects [22, 20], that 
span the parallel machine domain, for collective computation and communication. Thus data-parallelism 
can be supported. Since rope objects are parallel objects, they can be customized, interestingly, in a 
serial or a parallel manner. Spatial transparency of objects is achieved by global pointer templates. 
We present results from a prototype system running on the SGI Challenge and the Intel Paragon.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper proposes a framework for predicate detection in systems of processes with approximately-synchronized real-time clocks. Timestamps from these clocks are used to define two orderings on 
events: "definitely occurred before" and "possibly occurred before". These orderings lead naturally 
to definitions of 3 distinct detection modalities, i.e., 3 meanings of "predicate held during a computation", namely: Poss T (" possibly held"), Def T (" definitely held"), and Inst (" 
definitely held at a specific instant"). This paper defines these modalities and gives efficient algorithms for detecting them; the algorithms are based on algorithms of Cooper and Marzullo, Garg 
and Waldecker, and Fromentin and Raynal.  </abstract>

<date> Jan. 31, 1996, revised Aug. 28, 1996  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
This study describes a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system for segmenting uncharacterized genomic DNA sequences into exons, introns, and intergenic 
regions. Separate HMM modules were designed and trained for specific regions of 
DNA: exons, introns, intergenic regions, and splice sites. The models were then 
tied together to form a biologically feasible topology. The integrated HMM was 
trained further on a set of eukaryotic DNA sequences, and tested by using it to 
segment a separate set of sequences. The resulting HMM system, which is called 
VEIL (Viterbi Exon-Intron Locator), obtains an overall accuracy on test data of 
92% of total bases correctly labelled, with a correlation coefficient of 0.68. Using the more stringent test of exact exon prediction, VEIL correctly located both 
ends of 46% of the exons. Moreover, more than 50% of the exons it predicts are 
exactly correct. These results compare favorably to the best previous results for 
gene structure prediction, and demonstrate the benefits of using HMMs for this 
problem.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The Two-Level Hypermedia Paradigm sees an 
Information Retrieval System as consisting of 
a document network (the Hyperbase) and a 
descriptor (term) network (the Hyperindex). 
Query by Navigation is a process whereby the 
searcher gives a description of the Information Need by travelling through the descriptor 
network. This paper presents a formalism for 
expressing the effects of traversing the Hyper-index on the elements of the Hyperindex. This 
formalism makes use of probabilities for mod-elling the searcher's behavious. The events 
which can occur during the search process 
are discussed and modelled. Some important 
properties, which are reasonable to demand of 
a retrieval system, can be proven to be valid 
if this formalism is adopted. A mechanism 
for assigning a measure of relevance to documents is presented. This uses the formalism 
mentioned above. An example will show the 
effectiveness of The aspect of relevance feedback and its role in Query by Navigation is 
introduced by examining the different level on 
which the searcher can offer information for 
weeding out unwanted sections of the search 
space. In order to illustrate the workings of 
Query by Navigation a small example is included.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
For succesful information systems development, conceptual data modelling is essential. 
Nowadays many techniques for conceptual data modelling exist, examples are NIAM, FORM, 
PSM, many (E)ER variants, IFO, and FDM. In-depth comparisons of concepts of these techniques is very difficult as the mathematical formalisations of these techniques, if existing at 
all, are very different. As such there is a need for a unifying formal framework providing a 
sufficiently high level of abstraction. In this paper the use of category theory for this purpose 
is addressed. Well-known conceptual data modelling concepts are discussed from a category

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we present results of experiments carried out with a route learning system for a 
mobile robot, conducted in a `real world' environment covering distances of several hundred metres. 
The system uses no odometry and is based on a self-organising mapbuilding process using perceptual 
landmarks. 
A performance metric is defined and used to measure the robot's ability to traverse the route.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
It is argued that the following three properties are foundations of robust robot 
navigation: 
* The use of landmarks (and, in particular, the use of a compass sense), 
* the use of canonical paths, and 
* the use of topological rather than geometrical maps. 
Some examples of successful animal navigation are presented that support this view. 
We have performed initial experiments with mobile robots to investigate mechanisms 
suitable to implement such navigational architectures. Experiments concerning navigation by dead reckoning are presented, and a differential light compass is introduced 
to aid robot navigation.  </abstract>

<title> Error-Correcting Output Codes: 
A General Method for Improving 
Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs  </title>

<address> Corvallis, OR 97331-3202  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a 
discrete set containing k &gt; 2 values (i.e., k "classes"). 
The definition is acquired by studying large collections 
of training examples of the form hx i ; f(x i )i. Existing 
approaches to this problem include (a) direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree 
algorithms ID3 and CART, (b) application of binary 
concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary 
functions for each of the k classes, and (c) application 
of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed 
output codes such as those employed by Sejnowski and 
Rosenberg in the NETtalk system. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in 
which BCH error-correcting codes are employed as a 
distributed output representation. We show that these 
output representations improve the performance of ID3 
on the NETtalk task and of backpropagation on an 
isolated-letter speech-recognition task. These results 
demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass 
problems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A new set of tools for verifying smoothness of surfaces generated by stationary 
subdivision algorithms is presented. The main challenge here is the verification of 
injectivity of the characteristic map. The tools are sufficiently versatile and easy 
to wield to allow, as an application, a full analysis of algorithms generalizing bi-quadratic and bicubic B-spline subdivision. In the case of generalized biquadratic 
subdivision the analysis yields a hitherto unknown sharp bound strictly less than 
one on the second largest eigenvalue of any smoothly converging subdivision.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes the performance evaluation of six temporal reasoning systems. 
We show that if you are working with large temporal datasets where information 
is added incrementally throughout the execution of the program, systems using incompletely connected graphs (i.e., TMM, TimeGraph and TimeGraph-II) seem the 
best option. While they do not offer the constant query time of systems using fully 
connected graphs (i.e. the systems based on constraint satisfaction), the savings at 
assertion time are so substantial that the relatively small performance penalty for 
queries is a reasonable tradeoff. Of course, these systems do not offer the expressiv 
ity of the interval-based systems as they only handle point-based relations. Of the 
three, TimeGraph-II offers a wider range of qualitative relations as it handles point 
inequality. It does not currently handle metric information, however, as do TMM 
and TimeGraph. Thus decisions between these three may be more determined by the 
reasoning capabilities required rather than raw performance.

<title> Utterance Units in Spoken Dialogue  </title>
<author> David R. Traum 1 and Peter A. Heeman 2  </author>
<abstract> Abstract. In order to make spoken dialogue systems more sophisticated, designers need to better understand the conventions that people 
use in structuring their speech and in interacting with their fellow con-versants. In particular, it is crucial to discriminate the basic building 
blocks of dialogue and how they affect the way people process language. Many researchers have proposed the utterance unit as the 
primary object of study, but defining exactly what this is has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider 
grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrences between 
turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit signals that have been 
proposed in the literal, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses. 
Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and 
boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses. We 
also consider some of the dialogue processing issues which are impacted by a definition of utterance unit.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Our research addresses the general topic of atomic update of shared data 
structures on large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors. In this paper 
we consider alternative implementations of the general-purpose single-address atomic primitives fetch and , compare and swap, load linked, 
and store conditional. These primitives have proven popular on small-scale bus-based machines, but have yet to become widely available on 
large-scale, distributed shared memory machines. We propose several alternative hardware implementations of these primitives, and then analyze 
the performance of these implementations for various data sharing patterns. Our results indicate that good overall performance can be obtained 
by implementing compare and swap in the cache controllers, and by pro 
viding an additional instruction to load an exclusive copy of a cache line.  </abstract>

<title> THE COMPLEXITY OF COMPUTING 
MAXIMAL WORD FUNCTIONS  </title>
<author> Eric Allender, Danilo Bruschi 
and Giovanni Pighizzini  </author>
<abstract> Abstract. Maximal word functions occur in data retrieval applications 
and have connections with ranking problems, which in turn were first 
investigated in relation to data compression [21]. By the "maximal word 
function" of a language L , we mean the problem of finding, on 
input x, the lexicographically largest word belonging to L that is smaller 
than or equal to x. 
In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for computing maximal 
word functions for languages recognized by one-way nondeterministic 
auxiliary pushdown automata (and hence for the class of context-free 
languages). 
This paper is a continuation of a stream of research focusing on the 
problem of identifying properties others than membership which are 
easily computable for certain classes of languages. For a survey, see [24].  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Bayesian inference begins with a prior distribution for model parameters that is 
meant to capture prior beliefs about the relationship being modeled. For multilayer 
perceptron networks, where the parameters are the connection weights, the prior 
lacks any direct meaning | what matters is the prior over functions computed 
by the network that is implied by this prior over weights. In this paper, I show 
that priors over weights can be defined in such a way that the corresponding 
priors over functions reach reasonable limits as the number of hidden units in the 
network goes to infinity. When using such priors, there is thus no need to limit the 
size of the network in order to avoid "overfitting". The infinite network limit also 
provides insight into the properties of different priors. A Gaussian prior for hidden-to-output weights results in a Gaussian process prior for functions, which can be 
smooth, Brownian, or fractional Brownian, depending on the hidden unit activation 
function and the prior for input-to-hidden weights. Quite different effects can be 
obtained using priors based on non-Gaussian stable distributions. In networks with 
more than one hidden layer, a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian priors 
appears most interesting.  </abstract>

top-down, bottom-up and lateral connections. These connections 
can be learned using simple rules that require only locally available information. We then show how to incorporate lateral connections into the generative model. The model extracts a sparse, 
distributed, hierarchical representation of depth from simplified 
random-dot stereograms and the localised disparity detectors in 
the first hidden layer form a topographic map. When presented 
with image patches from natural scenes, the model develops topo 
graphically organised local feature detectors.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Multi-armed bandits may be viewed as 
decompositionally-structured Markov decision processes (MDP's) with potentially very-large state sets. A particularly elegant 
methodology for computing optimal policies 
was developed over twenty ago by Gittins 
[Gittins & Jones, 1974]. Gittins' approach 
reduces the problem of finding optimal policies for the original MDP to a sequence of 
low-dimensional stopping problems whose solutions determine the optimal policy through 
the so-called "Gittins indices." Katehakis 
and Veinott [Katehakis & Veinott, 1987] have 
shown that the Gittins index for a process 
in state i may be interpreted as a particular 
component of the maximum-value function 
associated with the "restart-in-i" process, 
a simple MDP to which standard solution 
methods for computing optimal policies, such 
as successive approximation, apply. This paper explores the problem of learning the Git-tins indices on-line without the aid of a process model; it suggests utilizing process-state-specific Q-learning agents to solve their respective restart-in-state-i subproblems, and 
includes an example in which the online reinforcement learning approach is applied to 
a problem of stochastic scheduling|one instance drawn from a wide class of problems 
that may be formulated as bandit problems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Several researchers have proposed modeling 
temporally abstract actions in reinforcement 
learning by the combination of a policy and a termination condition, which we refer to as an option. Value functions over options and models of 
options can be learned using methods designed 
for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). 
However, all these methods require an option to 
be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from 
small fragments of experience consistent with 
that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience 
within an option. Intra-option methods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporal-difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously 
about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the 
consequences of options. We present computational examples in which these new methods 
learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn 
effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at 
all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intra 
option value learning.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Tracking and evaluating the progress of large, complex plans or 
schedules as they unfold in real time is extremely difficult for humans. 
In this paper we present a mixed-initiative system for the task of schedule maintenance in a simulated shipping network. A schedule maintenance agent monitors the network, predicting the occurrence of states 
that may result in reduced throughput and formulating schedule modifications to avoid those states. The goal is to maximize throughput 
while minimizing disruptions to the original schedule. We present results of experiments in which human subjects attempt to obtain that 
goal both with and without the aid of the agent. We found that the human and the agent working together are able to achieve better results 
than either one working alone. In addition to looking at global performance measures such as throughput, we analyze individual schedule 
modification decisions made by subjects in an attempt to assign credit 
for the improvements in performance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Design-to-time is an approach to problem-solving in resource-constrained domains where: 
multiple solution methods are available for tasks, those solution methods make tradeoffs in 
solution quality versus time, and satisficing solutions are acceptable. Design-to-time involves 
designing a solution to a problem that uses all available resources to maximize the solution 
quality within the available time. This paper defines the design-to-time approach in detail, 
contrasting it to the anytime algorithm approach, and presents a heuristic algorithm for design-to-time real-time scheduling. 
Our blackboard architecture that implements the design-to-time approach is discussed and 
an example problem and solution from the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) is 
described in detail. Experimental results, generated using a simulation, show the effects of 
various parameters on scheduler performance. Finally we discuss future research goals and 
plans.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present a new approach that enables compiler 
optimization of procedure calls and loop nests containing procedure calls. We introduce two inter-procedural transformations that move loops across procedure boundaries, exposing them to traditional optimizations on loop nests. These transformations are 
incorporated into a code generation algorithm for a 
shared-memory multiprocessor. The code generator relies on a machine model to estimate the expected benefits of loop parallelization and parallelism-enhancing 
transformations. Several transformation strategies are 
explored and one that minimizes total execution time is 
selected. Efficient support of this strategy is provided 
by an existing interprocedural compilation system. We 
demonstrate the potential of these techniques by applying this code generation strategy to two scientific 
applications programs.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The availability of low-cost computational power is a driving force behind the growing sophistication 
of CAD software. Tools designed to reduce time-consuming build-test-redesign iterations are essential 
for increasing engineering quality and productivity. However, automation of the design process poses 
many difficult computational problems. As more downstream engineering activities are being considered 
during the design phase, guaranteeing reasonable response times within design systems becomes problematic. Design is an interactive process and speed is a critical factor in systems that enable designers to 
explore and experiment with alternative ideas during the design phase. Achieving interactivity requires 
an increasingly sophisticated allocation of computational resources in order to perform realistic design 
analyses and generate feedback in real time. 
This paper presents our initial efforts to develop techniques to apply distributed algorithms to the 
problem of recognizing machining features from solid models. Existing work on recognition of features 
has focused exclusively on serial computer architectures. Our objective is to show that distributed 
algorithms can be employed on realistic parts with large numbers of features and many geometric and 
topological entities to obtain significant improvements in computation time using existing hardware and 
software tools. Migrating solid modeling applications toward a distributed computing framework enables 
interconnection of many of the autonomous and geographically diverse software tools used in the modern 
manufacturing enterprise.

<abstract> Abstract 
We recently introduced a new flow control scheme, called send-time control, which is 
based on a deterministic model of virtual circuits in a computer network. In this scheme, 
the time at which a packet is sent by a source is computed from estimates of round-trip 
time, traffic in the network and bottleneck service time. In this paper, we describe a new 
transport protocol, called DTP, which uses send-time control as its flow control scheme. 
Preliminary measurements of coast-to-coast connections over the Internet show significant 
performance improvement over TCP, which is the most commonly used transport protocol 
in the Internet today.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
As network latency drops below disk latency, access time to a remote disk will begin 
to approach local disk access time. The performance of I/O may then be improved 
by spreading disk pages across several remote disk servers and accessing disk pages 
in parallel. To research this we have prototyped a data page server called a Page 
File. This persistent data type provides a set of methods to access disk pages stored 
on a cluster of remote machines acting as disk servers. The goal is to improve the 
throughput of database management system or other I/O intensive application by 
accessing pages from remote disks and incurring disk latency in parallel. This report 
describes the conceptual foundation and the methods of access for our prototype.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Traditional inter-domain routing protocols based on superdomains maintain either "strong" 
or "weak" ToS and policy constraints for each visible superdomain. With strong constraints, 
a valid path may not be found even though one exists. With weak constraints, an invalid 
domain-level path may be treated as a valid path. 
We present an inter-domain routing protocol based on superdomains, which always finds 
a valid path if one exists. Both strong and weak constraints are maintained for each visible 
superdomain. If the strong constraints of the superdomains on a path are satisfied, then the 
path is valid. If only the weak constraints are satisfied for some superdomains on the path, the 
source uses a query protocol to obtain a more detailed "internal" view of these superdomains, 
and searches again for a valid path. Our protocol handles topology changes, including node/link 
failures that partition superdomains. Evaluation results indicate our protocol scales well to large 
internetworks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents a detailed comparison of the relative importance of allowing concurrent writers 
versus the choice of the underlying consistency model. Our comparison is based on single- and multiple-writer versions of a lazy release consistent (LRC) protocol, and a single-writer sequentially consistent 
protocol, all implemented in the CVM software distributed shared memory system. 
We find that in our environment, which we believe to be representative of distributed systems today 
and in the near future, the consistency model has a much higher impact on overall performance than the 
choice of whether to allow concurrent writers. The multiple writer protocol performs an average of 9% 
better than the single writer LRC protocol, but 34% better than the single-writer sequentially consistent 
protocol. Set against this, MW-LRC required an average of 72% memory overhead, compared to 10% 
overhead for the single-writer protocols.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a hybrid method for synthesis of hierarchical structured Petri nets. In a top-down manner, we decompose a system into a set of subsystems at each level of abstraction, each 
of these is specified as a blackbox Petri net that has multiple inputs and outputs. We stipulate 
that each subsystem satisfies the following I/O constraints: (1) At any instance of time, at 
most one of the inputs can be activated; and (2) If one input is activated, then the subsystem 
must consume the input and produce exactly one output within a finite length of time. We 
give a stepwise refinement procedure which starts from the initial high-level abstraction of the 
system and expands an internal place of a blackbox Petri net into a more detailed subnet at 
each step. By enforcing the I/O constraints of each subsystem in each intermediate abstraction, 
our refinement maintains the sequencing of transitions prescribed by the initial abstraction of 
the system. Next, for the bottom-up synthesis, we present interconnection rules for sequential, 
parallel, and loop structures and prove that each rule maintains the I/O constraints. Thus, by 
incorporating these interconnection rules into our refinement formulation, our approach can be 
regarded as a hybrid Petri net synthesis technique that employs both top-down and bottom-up 
methods. The major advantage of the method is that the modeling details can be introduced 
incrementally and naturally, while the important logical properties of the resulting Petri net are 
guaranteed.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a new bandwidth allocation scheme for VBR video traffic in ATM networks. 
The scheme is tailored to MPEG-coded video sources that require stringent and deterministic 
quality-of-service guarantees. By exploiting the temporal structure of MPEG sources, we show 
that our scheme results in an effective bandwidth which, in most cases, is less than the source 
peak rate. The reduction in the bandwidth requirement is achieved without sacrificing any 
perceived QoS. Efficient procedures are provided for the computation of the effective bandwidth 
under heterogeneous MPEG sources. The effective bandwidth strongly depends on the arrangement of the multiplexed streams which is a measure of the degree of synchronization between the 
GOP patterns of different streams. Assuming that all possible arrangements are equi-probable, 
we derive an expression for the asymptotic tail distribution of the effective bandwidth. From 
the tail distribution, we compute several performance measures for the call blocking probability 
when the allocation is made based on the effective bandwidth. In the case of homogeneous 
sources, we give a closed-form expression for the `best' arrangement that results in the `optimal' 
effective bandwidth. Numerical examples based on real MPEG traces are used to demonstrate 
the advantages of our scheme.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) have 
been working together to develop the ProgramFinder, a tool for choosing programs for a troubled youth from drug 
rehabilitation centers to secure residential facilities. The seemingly straightforward journey of the ProgramFinder 
from an existing user interface technique to a product design required the development of five different prototypes 
which involved user interface design, prototype implementation, and selecting search criterion. While HCILs effort 
focused primarily on design and implementation, DJJs attribute selection process was the most time consuming and 
difficult task. We also found that a direct link to DJJs workflow was needed in the prototypes to generate the 
necessary buy-in. This paper analyzes the interaction between the efforts of HCIL and DJJ and the amount of buy-in by DJJ staff and management. Lesson learned are presented for developers.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of several policies for managing the effect 
of delay jitter on the playout of audio and video in computer-based conferences. The problem 
addressed is that of managing the fundamental tradeoff between display with low latency and 
display with few gaps. We describe a particular policy called queue monitoring which 
observes delay jitter over time and dynamically adjusts display latency in order to support 
low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by 
comparing it with two policies from the literature in a study based on measurements from a 
computer-based conferencing system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs as 
well or better than the other policies over the range of observed network loads. More 
importantly, we show that queue monitoring performs better on those network loads for 
which the other policies exhibit poor performance.  </abstract>

<title> Real-Time Computing with Lock-Free Shared Objects  </title>
<author> James H. Anderson Srikanth Ramamurthy Kevin Jeffay  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, </affiliation> <address> Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3175  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
This paper considers the use of lock-free shared objects 
within hard real-time systems. As the name suggests, 
lock-free shared objects are distinguished by the fact 
that they are not locked. As such, they do not give 
rise to priority inversions, a key advantage over conventional, lock-based object-sharing approaches. Despite this advantage, it is not immediately apparent 
that lock-free shared objects can be employed if tasks 
must adhere to strict timing constraints. In particular, 
lock-free object implementations permit concurrent operations to interfere with each other, and repeated interferences can cause a given operation to take an arbitrarily long time to complete. 
The main contribution of this paper is to show that 
such interferences can be bounded by judicious scheduling. This work pertains to periodic, hard real-time 
tasks that share lock-free objects on a uniprocessor. In 
the first part of the paper, scheduling conditions are derived for such tasks, for both static and dynamic priority schemes. Based on these conditions, it is formally 
shown that lock-free object-sharing approaches can be 
expected to incur much less overhead than approaches 
based on wait-free objects or lock-based schemes. In 
the last part of the paper, this conclusion is validated experimentally through work involving a real-time desktop videoconferencing system.  </abstract>

<date> March 14, 1997  </date>
<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Sync is a new Java-based framework for developing collaborative applications for wireless mobile 
systems. Sync is based on objectoriented replication and offers high-level synchronization-aware classes 
based on existing Java classes. Programmers may also extend the Sync-provided classes to create new 
replicated classes, either to add functionality or to modify a classs merge policy. Sync supports fully 
disconnected operation and employs centralized, asynchronous synchronization. Application programmers 
use the Sync framework to define conflicts and specify conflict resolution on the basis of the applications 
structure and semantics. 
We discuss the general needs of wireless mobile applications, and present a high-function example 
application that would be useful to mobile users, to be used for illustration throughout the paper. Next we 
discuss related work, and evaluate each work relative to its ability to support the example application. We 
then present the Sync framework, motivating each feature with its use in the example application.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The relation between the orthography and the phonology of a language has 
traditionally been modelled by hand-crafted rule sets. Machine-learning (ML) 
approaches offer a means to gather this knowledge automatically. Problems 
arise when the training material is sparse. Generalising from sparse data 
is a well-known problem for many ML algorithms. We present experiments 
in which connectionist, instance-based, and decision-tree learning algorithms 
are applied to a small corpus of Scottish Gaelic. instance-based learning in the 
ib1-ig algorithm yields the best generalisation performance, and that most 
algorithms tested perform tolerably well. Given the availability of a lexicon, 
even if it is sparse, ML is a valuable and efficient tool for automatic phonetic 
transcription of written text.  </abstract>

may export many different categories of names: instances, components of records, types, etc. Operating 
systems export the names of files, devices, and services. Integrating an object base with existing operating system facilities can improve accessibility of the 
object base resources. We consider the benefits and 
pitfalls of integrating an object base namespace with

<abstract> Abstract 
Many emerging applications (e.g., teleconference, real-time 
information services, pay per view, distributed interactive 
simulation, and collaborative work) are based upon a group 
communications model, i.e., they require packet delivery 
from one or more authorized senders to a very large number 
of authorized receivers. As a result, securing group communications (i.e., providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages delivered between group members) 
will become a critical networking issue. 
In this paper, we present a novel solution to the scalability problem of group/multicast key management. We 
formalize the notion of a secure group as a triple (U; K; R) 
where U denotes a set of users, K a set of keys held by the 
users, and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key 
graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key 
graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave, and specify protocols 
for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype 
group key server we have built. We present measurement 
results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large 
groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the 
average measured processing time per join/leave increases 
linearly with the logarithm of group size.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Planning systems have become an important tool for automating a wide variety 
of tasks. Control knowledge guides a planner to find solutions quickly and is crucial 
for efficient planning in most domains. Machine learning techniques enable a planning 
system to automatically acquire domain-specific search-control knowledge for different 
applications. Past approaches to learning control information have usually employed 
explanation-based learning (EBL) to generate control rules. Unfortunately, EBL alone 
often produces overly complex rules that actually decrease rather than improve overall 
planning efficiency. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge 
acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive 
logic programming. In our learning system Scope, EBL is used to constrain an inductive search for control heuristics that help a planner choose between competing plan 
refinements. Scope is one of the few systems to address learning control information for newer, partial-order planners. Specifically, this proposal describes how Scope 
learns domain-specific control rules for the UCPOP planning algorithm. The resulting 
system is shown to produce significant speedup in two different planning domains, and 
to be more effective than a pure EBL approach. Future research will be performed 
in three main areas. First, Scope's learning algorithm will be extended to include 
additional techniques such as constructive induction and rule utility analysis. Second, 
Scope will be more thoroughly tested; several real-world planning domains have been 
identified as possible testbeds, and more in-depth comparisons will be drawn between 
Scope and other competing approaches. Third, Scope will be implemented in a different planning system in order to test its portability to other planning algorithms. This 
work should demonstrate that machine-learning techniques can be a powerful tool in 
the quest for tractable real-world planning.  </abstract>

Nested loop execution of object-oriented queries retains 
the promise of maintaining the full generality of the object paradigm, independent of the specifics of any single 
object model. Thus, from this starting point we have 
developed an object-oriented query optimizer and execution engine. The methods, developed to date for only 
acyclic queries, augment nested loops structures with a 
simple marking mechanism such that unnecessary loop 
iterations are not repeated. In the case of acyclic queries, 
the executions are asymptotically optimal. In contrast to 
optimal query methods based on semijoin reductions our 
method involves no preprocessing step and thus avoids 
the extra I/O associated with semijoins and prevents the 
formal benefits of semijoin reduction from appearing as a 
practical improvement. Empirical results comparing our 
query environment with a commercially available product 
demonstrate significant performance improvement.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A common task in automated manufacturing processes is to orient parts prior to 
assembly. We address sensorless orientation of a polygonal part on a conveyor belt by 
a sequence of stationary fences across this belt. Since fences can only push against the 
motion of the belt, it is a challenging problem to compute fence designs which orients 
a given part. In this paper, we give several polynomial-time, algorithms to compute 
fence designs which are optimal with respect to various criteria. We address both 
frictionless and frictional fences. We also compute modular fence designs in which 
the fence angles are restricted to a discrete set of angles instead of an interval.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A bandwidth control mechanism is proposed for ATM 
networks that can control the usage of bandwidth in the 
presence of both connection-oriented and connection-less traffic, as well as multiple classes of connectionless 
traffic. The bandwidth control mechanism operates at 
three levels. At the topmost level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between connection-oriented and 
connectionless traffic based on the utilization of each 
traffic type. At the next level, bandwidth is controlled 
between different classes of connectionless traffic, such 
as real-time traffic, bulk data traffic, and so on. At the 
lowest level, bandwidth is distributed among flows belonging to the same connectionless traffic class.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. The demand for computing and computing power is increasing at a rapid pace. With this demand, 
the ability to develop, enhance and maintain software is a top priority. Educating students to do competent 
work in software development, enhancement and maintenance has become a complex problem. Software 
engineering concepts are typically not introduced in beginning computer science courses. Students do not see 
software engineering until the third or fourth year of the curriculum. We do not believe students can acquire 
an adequate software engineering foundation with the present approach. We believe an emphasis on software 
engineering should begin in the very first course and continue throughout the curriculum. We are redesigning 
our curriculum to reect this. The first course of the new curriculum is complete. This article focuses on two 
of the laboratory activities we have developed which deal with specific software engineering concepts.  </abstract>

<title> Isotach Networks  </title>
<author> Paul F. Reynolds, Jr.

Raymond R. Wagner, Jr.  </author>
<abstract> Abstract We introduce a class of networks called isotach networks designed to reduce the 
cost of concurrency control in asynchronous computations. Isotach networks support several 
properties important to the correct execution of parallel and distributed computations: atomi-city, causal message delivery, sequential consistency, and memory coherence in systems in 
which shared data can replicate and migrate. They allow processes to execute atomic actions 
without locks and to pipeline memory accesses without sacrificing sequential consistency. Iso-tach networks can be implemented in a wide variety of configurations, including NUMA (nonuniform memory access) multiprocessors and distributed as well as parallel systems. Networks 
that implement isotach time systems are characterized not by their topology, but by the guarantees they make about the relative order in which messages appear to be delivered. These 
guarantees are expressed in logical time, not physical time. Physical time guarantees would be 
prohibitively expensive, whereas logical time guarantees can be enforced cheaply, using purely 
local knowledge, and yet are powerful enough to support efficient techniques for coordinating 
asynchronously executing processes. Empirical and analytic studies of isotach systems show 
that they outperform conventional systems under realistic workloads, in some cases by an order 
of magnitude or more.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Tracing tools are used widely to help analyze, design, and tune 
both hardware and software systems. This paper describes a tool 
called Shade which combines efficient instruction-set simulation 
with a flexible, extensible trace generation capability. Efficiency 
is achieved by dynamically compiling and caching code to simulate and trace the application program. The user may control the 
extent of tracing in a variety of ways; arbitrarily detailed application state information may be collected during the simulation, but 
tracing less translates directly into greater efficiency. Current 
Shade implementations run on SPARC systems and simulate the 
SPARC (Versions 8 and 9) and MIPS I instruction sets. This 
paper describes the capabilities, design, implementation, and performance of Shade, and discusses instruction set emulation in 
general.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In computer systems with large, physically-indexed, 
direct-mapped caches, a poor mapping from virtual to 
physical pages causes excessive cache conflict misses. 
In a previous paper we proposed a simple hardware device, the Cache Miss Lookaside (CML) Buffer, which 
identifies pages that are suffering from conflict misses. 
The operating system can use this information to implement a dynamic page mapping policy that resolves 
conflicts by performing an in-memory copy of one of 
the conflicting pages, and updating the virtual to physical mappings. In this paper, we propose several dynamic page mapping policies that detect and resolve 
cache conflicts using hardware available in existing systems, such as a TLB and cache miss counter, to locate 
possible cache conflicts. We evaluate the simulated 
performance of a variety of mapping policies, and show 
that a dynamic page mapping policy using standard 
hardware can improve upon the performance of a static 
policy, but is not as effective as special-purpose hardware such as an associative cache or a CML buffer. 
We also describe the implementation and performance 
of a software-based dynamic policy on a DEC Alpha 
workstation running DEC OSF/1.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
User-level threads have performance and flexibility advantages over both Unix-like processes 
and kernel threads. However, the performance of user-level threads may suffer in multipro-grammed environments, or when threads block in the kernel (e.g., for I/O). These problems 
can be particularly severe in tasks that communicate frequently using IPC (e.g., multithreaded 
servers), due to interactions between the user-level thread scheduler and the operating system 
IPC primitives. Efficient IPC typically involves processor handoff that blocks the caller and 
unblocks a thread in the callee; when combined with user-level threads, this can cause problems 
for both caller and callee, particularly if the caller thread should subsequently block. 
In this paper we describe a new user-level thread package, called OThreads, designed to 
support blocking and efficient IPC for a system based on traditional kernel threads. We discuss 
the extent to which these problems can be solved at the user level without kernel changes 
such as scheduler activations. Our conclusion is that problems caused by application-controlled 
blocking and IPC can be resolved in the user-level thread package, but that problems due 
to multiprogramming workload and unanticipated blocking such as page faults require kernel 
changes such as scheduler activations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present a new method for accelerating walkthroughs of geometrically complex static 
scenes. As a preprocessing step, our method constructs a BSP-tree that hierarchically partitions the geometric primitives in the scene. In the course of a walkthrough, images of nodes 
at various levels of the hierarchy are cached for reuse in subsequent frames. A cached image is applied as a texture map to a single quadrilateral that is drawn instead of the geometry 
contained in the corresponding node. Visual artifacts are kept under control by using an error metric that quantifies the discrepancy between the appearance of the geometry contained 
in a node and the cached image. The new method is shown to achieve significant speedups 
for a walkthrough of a complex outdoor scene, with little or no loss in rendering quality.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Subdivision surfaces provide a curved surface representation that is useful in a number of applications, including modeling surfaces of arbitrary topological type [5] , fitting scattered data [6] , and geometric compression 
and automatic level-of-detail generation using wavelets [8] . Subdivision surfaces also provide an attractive representation for fast rendering, since they can directly represent complex surfaces of arbitrary topology. This direct 
representation contrasts with traditional approaches such as trimmed NURBS, in which tesselating trim regions 
dominates rendering time, and algebraic implicit surfaces, in which rendering requires resultants, root finders, or 
other computationally expensive techniques. 
We present a method for subdivision surface triangulation that is fast, uses minimum memory, and is simpler in 
structure than a naive rendering method based on direct subdivision. These features make the algorithm amenable 
to implementation on dedicated geometry engine processors, allowing high rendering performance on appropri 
ately equipped graphics hardware.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Linear equality and inequality constraints arise naturally in specifying many aspects of user 
interfaces, such as requiring that one window be to the left of another, requiring that a pane 
occupy the leftmost 1/3 of a window, or preferring that an object be contained within a rectangle if possible. Current constraint solvers designed for UI applications cannot efficiently 
handle simultaneous linear equations and inequalities. This is a major limitation. We describe 
Cassowary|an incremental algorithm based on the dual simplex method that can solve such 
systems of constraints efficiently.  </abstract>
<note> This informal technical report describes the latest version of the Cassowary algorithm. It is 
derived from the paper "Solving Linear Arithmetic Constraints for User Interface Applications" 
by Alan Borning, Kim Marriott, Peter Stuckey, and Yi Xiao [7], published in the UIST'97 
Proceedings. The UIST paper also contains a description of QOCA, a closely related solver 
that finds least-squares solutions to linear constraints. This technical report, which is intended 
to be self-contained, includes material on Cassowary from the UIST paper, plus a description 
of the Java, C++, and Smalltalk implementations and their interfaces. along with additional 
details, corrections, and clarifications. 
An earlier technical report also discussed QOCA and the similarities between Cassowary and 
that algorithm [6].  </note>

<title> On multivariate polynomial interpolation  </title>
<author> Carl de Boor 1 & Amos Ron  </author>
<abstract> ABSTRACT 
We provide a map fi 7! fi which associates each finite set fi of points in C s with a polynomial 
space fi from which interpolation to arbitrary data given at the points in fi is possible and uniquely 
so. Among all polynomial spaces Q from which interpolation at fi is uniquely possible, our fi 
is of smallest degree. It is also D- and scale-invariant. Our map is monotone, thus providing a 
Newton form for the resulting interpolant. Our map is also continuous within reason, allowing us to 
interpret certain cases of coalescence as Hermite interpolation. In fact, our map can be extended to 
the case where, with each 2 fi, there is associated a polynomial space P , and, for given smooth 
f , a polynomial q 2 Q is sought for which 
p(D)(f q)() = 0; all p 2 P ; 2 fi: 
We obtain fi as the "scaled limit at the origin" (Exp fi ) # of the exponential space Exp fi with 
frequencies fi, and base our results on a study of the map H 7! H # defined on subspaces H of 
the space of functions analytic at the origin. This study also allows us to determine the local 
approximation order from such H and provides an algorithm for the construction of H # from any 
basis for H.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of 
a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer 
is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour, 
surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour. 
Unlike previous approaches for recovering shape from the occluding contour, we use an 
observer that purposefully changes viewpoint in order to achieve a well-defined geometric relationship with respect to a 3D shape prior to its recognition. We show that there 
is a simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer to align their viewing 
direction with one of the two principal directions for a point on the surface. This strategy depends on only curvature measurements on the occluding contour and therefore 
demonstrates that recovering quantitative shape information from the contour does not 
require knowledge of the velocities or accelerations of the observer. Experimental results 
demonstrate that our method can be easily implemented and can provide reliable shape 
information from the occluding contour.  </abstract>

This paper presents the Plannett system, which 
combines artificial neural networks to achieve expert- 
level accuracy on the difficult scientific task of recognizing volcanos in radar images of the surface of the 
planet Venus. Plannett uses ANNs that vary along 
two dimensions: the set of input features used to train 
and the number of hidden units. The ANNs are combined simply by averaging their output activations. 
When Plannett is used as the classification module 
of a three-stage image analysis system called JAR- 
tool, the end-to-end accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is as good as that of a human planetary geologist on a four-image test suite. JARtool-Plannett 
also achieves the best algorithmic accuracy on these 
images to date.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A team of learning machines is a multiset of 
learning machines. A team is said to successfully learn a concept just in case each member 
of some nonempty subset, of predetermined 
size, of the team learns the concept. 
Team learning of computer programs for 
computable functions from their graphs has 
been studied extensively. However, team 
learning of languages turns out to be a 
more suitable theoretical model for studying 
computational limits on multi-agent machine 
learning. The main reason for this is that 
language learning can model both learning 
from positive data and learning from positive 
and negative data, whereas function learning 
models only learning from positive and negative data. 
Some theoretical results about learnability of 
formal languages by teams of algorithmic machines are surveyed. Some new results about 
restricted classes of languages are presented. 
These results are mainly about two issues: redundancy and aggregation. The issue of redundancy deals with the impact of increasing 
the size of a team and increasing the number 
of machines required to be successful. The 
issue of aggregation deals with conditions under which a team may be replaced by a single 
machine without any loss in learning ability. 
Scenarios which can be modeled by team 
learning are also presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of assigning m points in the n-dimensional real space 
R n to k clusters is formulated as that of determining k centers in 
R n such that the sum of distances of each point to the nearest 
center is minimized. If a polyhedral distance is used, the problem 
can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave 
function on a polyhedral set which is shown to be equivalent to 
a bilinear program: minimizing a bilinear function on a polyhedral set. A fast finite k-Median Algorithm consisting of solving 
few linear programs in closed form leads to a stationary point of 
the bilinear program. Computational testing on a number of real-world databases was carried out. On the Wisconsin Diagnostic 
Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, k-Median training set correctness was comparable to that of the k-Mean Algorithm, however its 
testing set correctness was better. Additionally, on the Wisconsin 
Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC) database, distinct and clinically important survival curves were extracted by the k-Median 
Algorithm, whereas the k-Mean Algorithm failed to obtain such 
distinct survival curves for the same database.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In an effort to push the envelope of system performance, microprocessor designs are continually exploiting higher levels of 
instruction-level parallelism, resulting in increasing bandwidth demands on the address translation mechanism. Most current microprocessor designs meet this demand with a multi-ported TLB. While 
this design provides an excellent hit rate at each port, its access latency and area grow very quickly as the number of ports is increased. 
As bandwidth demands continue to increase, multi-ported designs 
will soon impact memory access latency. 
We present four high-bandwidth address translation mechanisms 
with latency and area characteristics that scale better than a multi-ported TLB design. We extend traditional high-bandwidth memory 
design techniques to address translation, developing interleaved and 
multi-level TLB designs. In addition, we introduce two new designs 
crafted specifically for high-bandwidth address translation. Piggyback ports are introduced as a technique to exploit spatial locality in 
simultaneous translation requests, allowing accesses to the same virtual memory page to combine their requests at the TLB access port. 
Pretranslation is introduced as a technique for attaching translations 
to base register values, making it possible to reuse a single translation many times. 
We perform extensive simulation-based studies to evaluate our 
designs. We vary key system parameters, such as processor model, 
page size, and number of architected registers, to see what effects 
these changes have on the relative merits of each approach. A number of designs show particular promise. Multi-level TLBs with as 
few as eight entries in the upper-level TLB nearly achieve the performance of a TLB with unlimited bandwidth. Piggyback ports 
combined with a lesser-ported TLB structure, e.g., an interleaved or 
multi-ported TLB, also perform well. Pretranslation over a single-ported TLB performs almost as well as a same-sized multi-level 
TLB with the added benefit of decreased access latency for physically indexed caches.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Constraints of a mathematical program are distributed among parallel processors together with an appropriately constructed augmented Lagrangian for each processor, which contains 
Lagrangian information on the constraints handled by the other processors. Lagrange multiplier information is then exchanged between processors. Convergence is established under suitable conditions

<abstract> Abstract. The computing time benefits of parallelism in database systems (achieved by using multiple processors to execute a query) must be weighed against communication, startup, and 
termination overhead costs that increase as a function of the number of processors used. We consider problems of minimizing overhead subject to allocating data among the processors according 
to specified loads. We present lower bounds for these combinatorial problems and demonstrate how 
processors may be optimally assigned for some problem classes.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This report presents results of a peer review of MQPs conducted within 
the Computer Science Department during the Summer of 1995 as part of a 
campus-wide MQP review. The goal of the report is to assess whether the 
department MQPs are accomplishing their educational goals. The report 
identifies problems that need to be addressed and trends that need to be 
continued to make the MQPs a worthwhile learning experience. It reflects 
data and evaluations for 27 MQPs, involving 43 computer science students, 
that were completed between the Summer of 1994 and the Spring of 1995. 
The report also makes comparisons to similar reviews done in 1991 and 1993. 
Overall, the large majority of the projects are meeting the educational 
goals of the department as good learning experiences. The reviews indicate 
the overall quality of the projects is good, about the same as in 1993 and 
a little better than 1991. The report draws a number of conclusions about 
the success of the projects based upon the data collected and evaluations 
done for this review. The report concludes with recommendations for future 
projects.  </abstract>

This article studies the following question: "When is it possible to decide, on the basis of images of point features observed by an imprecisely modeled two-camera stereo 
vision system, whether or not a prescribed robot positioning task has been accomplished with precision?" It is shown that for a stereo vision system with known epipo-lar geometry, whether or not such a positioning task has been accomplished can be 
decided with available data, just in case the task function which specifies the task is a 
projective invariant.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: High Performance Fortran (HPF) compilers 
and communication libraries with the standardized Message Passing Interface (MPI) are becoming widely available, easing the development of portable parallel applications on distributed-memory parallel processor systems. 
The recently developed Annai tool environment supports 
programming, debugging and tuning of both HPF- and 
MPI-based applications. Considering code development 
and subsequent maintenance time to be as important as ultimate performance, we address how sequential Fortran-77 
versions of the familiar NAS Parallel Benchmark kernels 
can be expediently parallelized with appropriate tool support. While automatic parallelization of scientific applications written in traditional sequential languages remains 
largely impractical, Annai provides users with high-level 
language extensions and integrated program engineering 
support tools. In this paper, Annai support is demonstrated primarily focusing on the MG (multigrid) kernel, 
with complementary examples selected from the other four 
kernels. Respectable performance and good scalability 
in most cases are obtained with this straightforward par-allelization strategy, even without recourse to platform-specific optimizations or major program transformations.  </abstract>

<address> New Britain, CT 06050  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
Explanations play a key role in operationalization-based anomaly detection techniques. In this paper 
we show that their role is not limited to anomaly detection; they can also be used for guiding automated 
knowledge base refinement. We introduce a refinement procedure which takes: (i) a small number of 
refinement rules (rather than test cases), and (ii) explanations constructed in an attempt to reveal the 
cause (or causes) for inconsistencies detected during 
the verification process, and returns rule revisions 
aiming to recover the consistency of the KB-theory. 
Inconsistencies caused by more than one anomaly 
are handled at the same time, which improves the 
efficiency of the refinement process.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, syntactic parsing is discussed in the context of connectionism. A new model - the Confluent 
Preorder Parser (CPP), is proposed which exemplifies the holistic parsing paradigm. Holistic parsing has the 
advantage that little assumption has to be made concerning the detailed parsing algorithm, which is often 
unknown or debatable, especially when human language understanding is concerned. In the CPP, syntactic 
parsing is achieved by transforming in a oneshot manner, from the connectionist representation of the sentence 
to the connectionist representation of the preorder traversal of its parse tree, instead of the parse tree itself. As 
revealed by the simulation experiments, generalization performance is excellent (as high as 90%). Besides, the 
CPP is also capable of parsing erroneous sentences and resolving syntactic ambiguities. A systematic study is 
conducted to explore the range of factors which can affect the effectiveness of it. This error-recovery capability 
is especially useful in natural language processing when incomplete or even ungrammatical sentences are to be 
dealt with.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Situated cognition (SC) claims that knowledge is mostly context-dependent and that symbolic descriptions elicited prior to direct experience are less important than functional units developed via direct 
experience with the current problem. If this were true, then we would need to modify the knowledge 
modeling approaches of KA which assume that re-using old symbolic descriptions are a productivity tool 
for new applications. There are numerous tools which, if added to conventional knowledge modeling, 
could be said to handle SC (e.g. machine learning, abduction, verification & validation tools, repertory 
grids, certain frameworks for decision support systems, expert critiquing systems, and ripple-down-rules). 
However, we require an experiment to assess the effectiveness of these tools as a response to SC.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents Splice, a batch meta-learning system, designed to learn locally stable concepts in domains with hidden changes 
in context. The majority of machine learning 
algorithms assume that target concepts remain stable over time. In many domains this 
assumption is invalid. For example, financial prediction, medical diagnosis, and network performance are domains in which target concepts may not remain stable. Unstable target concepts are often due to changes 
in a hidden context. Existing works on learning in the presence of hidden changes in con 
text use an incremental learning approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We analyze differences between two 
information-theoretically motivated approaches to statistical inference and model 
selection: the Minimum Description Length 
(MDL) principle, and the Minimum Message 
Length (MML) principle. Based on this 
analysis, we present two revised versions of 
MML: a pointwise estimator which gives 
the MML-optimal single parameter model, 
and a volumewise estimator which gives 
the MML-optimal region in the parameter 
space. Our empirical results suggest that 
with small data sets, the MDL approach 
yields more accurate predictions than the 
MML estimators. The empirical results 
also demonstrate that the revised MML 
estimators introduced here perform better 
than the original MML estimator suggested 
by Wallace and Freeman.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The graph topo-visual formalism has been shown to 
be well-suited to the task of visualizing complex relations on a set of elements. Unfortunately, most visual 
formalisms do not scale very well. This observation is 
particularly true of graphs, which even when hand-drawn 
by an artist, are seldom meaningful when the number of 
nodes or links exceeds a very modest threshold typically only a few hundred elements. This severe limitation 
has prompted many researchers to seek alternative visualization techniques that may eliminate, or, at the very 
least, raise this threshold. 
In this paper we analyze these recent efforts, describe 
an abstract space of presentation emphasis techniques, 
and locate the current approaches within this space. The 
contributions of this paper are several: (1) a significant 
portion of recent work is collected and reviewed; (2) a 
common set of criteria and a taxonomy of graph views 
are proposed; these, (3) permit a more direct comparison 
of previous work; which helps to, (4) identify common 
shortcomings and limitations; which in turn, (5) suggest 
future directions.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Evolving algebras (EAs) as defined by Yuri Gurevich constitute the basis of a powerful and elegant specification and verification 
method which has successfully been applied to the design and analysis of 
various kinds of discrete dynamic systems. Aiming at the development 
of a comprehensive EA-based specification and design environment, we 
introduce the concept of an evolving algebra abstract machine (EAM ) as 
a platform for the systematic development of EA tools; for instance, as 
required for machine based analysis and execution of EA specifications. 
We give a formal definition of the EAM ground model in terms of a 
universal evolving algebra, where we validate the correctness of the relation between evolving algebras (their theoretical foundations) and their 
EAM representation and interpretation. Our approach covers sequential 
as well as distributed evolving algebras.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. We provide concise abstract code for running the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute compiled Java programs, and define a 
general compilation scheme of Java programs to JVM code. These definitions, together with the definition of an abstract interpreter of Java 
programs given in our previous work [3], allow us to prove that any 
compiler that satisfies the conditions stated in this paper compiles Java 
code correctly. In addition we have validated our JVM and compiler 
specification through experimentation. 
The modularity of our definitions for Java, the JVM and the compilation 
scheme exhibit orthogonal language, machine and compiler components, 
which fit together and provide the basis for a stepwise and provably correct design-for-reuse. As a by-product we provide a challenging realistic 
case study for mechanical verification of a compiler correctness proof.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. We use the steam boiler control specification problem to illustrate how the evolving algebra approach to the specification and the 
verification of complex systems can be exploited for a reliable and well 
documented development of executable, but formally inspectable and 
systematically modifiable code. A hierarchy of stepwise refined abstract 
machine models is developed, the ground version of which can be checked 
for whether it faithfully reflects the informally given problem. The sequence of machine models yields various abstract views of the system, 
making the various design decisions transparent, and leads to a C++ 
program. This program has been demonstrated during the Dagstuhl-Meeting on Methods for Semantics and Specification, in June 1995, to 
control the Karlsruhe steam boiler simulator satisfactorily. 
The abstract machines are evolving algebras and thereby have a rigorous 
semantical foundation, allowing us to formalize and prove, under precisely stated assumptions, some typical sample properties of the system. 
This provides insight into the structure of the system which supports 
easily maintainable extensions and modifications of both the abstract 
specification and the implementation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Drawing on on our work in the area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, we propose the rudiments of a view of multiagent reasoning that relates current philosophical 
intuitions, theoretical foundations, and preliminary implementation. The philosophical 
position we take is a combination of Daniel Dennett's philosophy of the ladder of per-sonhood (consisting of rationality, intentionality, stance, reciprocity, communication, 
and consciousness) on one hand, and the utilitarian philosophy of selfish utility maximization on the other hand. The theories we incorporate are logics of knowledge and 
belief, which in addressing the multiagent issues can be developed based on a recursive 
version of the Kripke structure, and the related fields of utility, decision and game 
theories. Our preliminary implementation, the Recursive Modeling Method (RMM), 
lets an agent coordinate its actions with the actions of other agents, cooperate with 
them when appropriate, and rationally choose an optimal form of communication with 
them.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Plan recognition is the process of observing another agent's behavior(s) and inferring what, and 
possibly why, the agent is acting as it is. Plan recognition becomes a very important means of acquiring 
such information about other agents in situations and domains where explicit communication is either 
very costly, dangerous, or impossible. Performing plan recognition in a physical domain (i.e. the real 
world) forces the world's ubiquitous uncertainty upon the observing agent because of the necessity to 
use real sensors to make the observations. We have developed a multiple resolution, hierarchical plan 
recognition system to coordinate the motion of two interacting mobile robots. Uncertainty arises in the 
system from dead reckoning errors that accumulate while the robots are moving, as well as by errors 
in the computer vision system that is used to detect the other agent's behaviors. Based upon belief 
networks, the plan recognition system gracefully degrades in performance as the level of uncertainty 
about observations increase.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe a flexible experimental testbed, called MICE, for distributed artificial intelligence 
research. We argue that the adoption of MICE (or some other standard testbed) by the distributed 
artificial intelligence community can draw together the community and permit a much greater level 
of exchange of ideas, formalisms, and techniques. MICE allows an experimenter to specify the 
constraints and characteristics of an environment in which agents are simulated to act and interact, 
and does not assume any particular implementation of an agent's reasoning architecture. MICE 
therefore provides a platform for investigating and evaluating alternative reasoning architectures 
and coordination mechanisms in many different simulated environments. We outline the design 
of MICE and illustrate its flexibility by describing simulated environments that model the coordination issues in domains such as predators chasing prey, predators attacking each other, agents 
fighting a fire, and diverse robots that are working together. In addition, we note that MICE's 
ability to simulate multi-agent environments makes it an ideal platform for studying reasoning in 
dynamic worlds; we can associate functionality to arbitrary objects in order to trigger changes in 
the environment. We conclude by discussing the status of MICE and how we are using MICE in 
our current research.  </abstract>

In this paper, a method is introduced for incorporating perfectly registered MRI boundary information into 
a penalized likelihood emission reconstruction scheme. 
The boundary curve is modeled as a periodic spline 
whose coefficients are estimated from the MRI image. 
The resulting boundary estimate is mapped to a spatially variant set of Gibbs weights. When incorporated into a quadratic roughness penalty, these weights 
improve emission reconstruction bias/variance performance by preventing smoothing across the estimated 
boundary.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Efficient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identified as one of the key requirements 
for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. While the current ITS literature has focused on 
the application of search algorithms (typically, heuristic A* algorithms) to provide for compute-on-demand 
path finding, we propose an encoded path view approach that precomputes optimal paths. Advantages of 
our approach include (1) route search is efficient and less dependent on system load, (2) alternative paths 
are materialized in addition to the optimal paths, simplifying the process of global optimization, (3) the 
storage overhead is manageable and less than for the full enumeration of all possible paths. In this paper, 
we present algorithms for incrementally updating the encoded path view structure in response to weight 
changes on the traffic links of the underlying network. Despite non-optimal paths also being materialized, our 
algorithms are designed to operate on cyclic planar graphs | given that ITS maps typically correspond to 
highly interconnected grid structures. In this paper, we show that while our approach does not encode all 
paths, it omits some non-optimal paths to resolve cycle ambivalence and will recover them once they become 
optimal. Proofs of correctness and of complexity are also given. We demonstrate the potential of our approach 
by presenting experimental results of evaluating our approach both on randomly generated as well as on real 
city map data. Our experiments furthermore compare the proposed approach against more conventional path 
searching algorithms, which correspond to the state-of-the-art for route guidance in ITS.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Efficient path query processing necessary for route guidance has been identified as one of the key requirements 
for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. 
While precomputing the view of all shortest paths provides 
the most efficient path retrieval, the view maintenance and 
storage costs become unrealistic for large ITS networks. Based 
on ITS road type classification, we propose a hierarchical 
path view approach, in which the path view maintenance 
and storage costs are dramatically reduced at the cost of 
negligible loss of path optimality. Comparing with the traditional ITS path finding approaches that use A or hierarchical A , our hierarchical approach is superior in three 
areas: 1) path search is more efficient, 2) the connecting 
point from the low-level roads to the high-level roads and 
vice versa are dynamically determined based on the most 
recent traffic, 3) within one region, the high-level traffic can 
be dynamically rerouted through the low-level roads. In 
this paper, we conduct experiments to gain insight into the 
performance of our proposed algorithms and model, as well 
as to contrast the difference in computational resource requirements between the hierarchical path view and the A  
algorithms.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Efficient path query processing is a key requirement for advanced 
database applications including GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems). We study the 
problem in the context of automobile navigation systems where a 
large number of path requests can be submitted over the transportation network within a short period of time. To guarantee efficient re-sponsefor path queries, we employ a path view materialization strategy for precomputing the best paths. We tackle the following three 
issues: (1) memory-resident solutions quickly exceed current computer storage capacity for networks of thousands of nodes, (2) disk-based solutions have been found inefficient to meet the stringent 
performance requirements, and (3) path views become too costly 
to update for large graphs. We propose the HEP V (Hierarchical 
Encoded Path View) approach that addresses these problems while 
guaranteeing the optimality of path retrieval. Our experimental results reveal that HEP V is more efficient than previously known 
path finding approaches.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We examine a standard factory scheduling 
problem with stochastic processing and setup 
times, minimizing the expectation of the 
weighted number of tardy jobs. Because 
the costs of operators in the schedule are 
stochastic and sequence dependent, standard 
dynamic programming algorithms such as 
A* may fail to find the optimal schedule. 
The SDA* (Stochastic Dominance A*) algorithm remedies this difficulty by relaxing the 
pruning condition. We present an improved 
state-space search formulation for these problems and discuss the conditions under which 
stochastic scheduling problems can be solved 
optimally using SDA*. In empirical testing 
on randomly generated problems, we found 
that in 70%, the expected cost of the optimal stochastic solution is lower than that of 
the solution derived using a deterministic ap 
proximation, with comparable search effort.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Concept hierarchies organize data and concepts in hierarchical forms or in certain partial order, which 
helps expressing knowledge and data relationships in databases in concise, high level terms, and thus, plays 
an important role in knowledge discovery processes. Concept hierarchies could be provided by knowledge 
engineers, domain experts or users, or embedded in some data relations. However, it is sometimes desirable to automatically generate some concept hierarchies or adjust some given hierarchies for particular 
learning tasks. In this paper, the issues of dynamic generation and refinement of concept hierarchies are 
studied. The study leads to some algorithms for automatic generation of concept hierarchies for numerical attributes based on data distributions and for dynamic refinement of a given or generated concept 
hierarchy based on a learning request, the relevant set of data and database statistics. These algorithms 
have been implemented in the DBLearn knowledge discovery system and tested against large relational 
databases. The experimental results show that the algorithms are efficient and effective for knowledge 
discovery in large databases.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
When autonomous agents attempt to coordinate action, it is often necessary that they reach 
some kind of consensus. Reaching consensus 
has traditionally been dealt with in the Distributed Artificial Intelligence literature via negotiation. Another alternative is to have agents 
use a voting mechanism; each agent expresses 
its preferences, and a group choice mechanism 
is used to select the result. Some choice mechanisms are better than others, and ideally we 
would like one that cannot be manipulated by 
untruthful agents. 
Coordination of actions by a group of agents 
corresponds to a group planning process. We 
here introduce a new multi-agent planning 
technique, that makes use of a dynamic, iterative search procedure. Through a process of 
group constraint aggregation, agents incrementally construct a plan that brings the group to 
a state maximizing social welfare. At each step, 
agents vote about the next joint action in the 
group plan (i.e., what the next transition state 
will be in the emerging plan). Using this technique agents need not fully reveal their preferences, and the set of alternative final states 
need not be generated in advance of a vote. 
With a minor variation, the entire procedure 
can be made resistant to untruthful agents.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all modern software quality assessment, assurance, 
and improvement techniques, and is acknowledged to be 
the most cost-effective form of quality improvement when 
practiced effectively. However, traditional FTR methods 
such as inspection are very difficult to adopt in organizations: they introduce substantial new up-front costs, 
training, overhead, and group process obstacles. Sustained commitment from high-level management along 
with substantial resources is often necessary for successful 
technology transfer of FTR. 
Since 1991, we have been designing and evaluating 
a series of versions of a system called CSRS: an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work environment for formal technical review. The current version of 
CSRS includes an FTR method definition language, which 
allows organizations to design their own FTR method, 
and to evolve it over time. This paper describes how our 
approach to computer supported FTR can address some 
of the issues in technology transfer of FTR.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Current collaborative learning systems focus on maximizing shared information. 
However, meaningful learning is not simply information sharing but also knowledge 
construction. CLARE is a computer-supported learning environment that facilitates 
meaningful learning through collaborative knowledge construction. It provides a semiformal representation language called RESRA and an explicit process model called 
SECAI. Experimental evaluation through 300 hours of classroom usage indicates that 
CLARE does support meaningful learning. It also shows that a major bottleneck to 
computer-mediated knowledge construction is summarization. Lessons learned through 
the design and evaluation of CLARE provide new insights into both collaborative learning 
systems and collaborative learning theories.  </abstract>

<title> Combinatory Differential Fields: 
An Algebraic Approach to 
Approximate Computation and 
Constructive Analysis   </title>
<author> Karl Aberer   </author>
<pubnum> TR-91-061  </pubnum>
<date> November 1991  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
The algebraic structure of combinatory differential fields is constructed to provide a semantics for computations in analysis. In this setting programs, approximations, limits and operations of analysis are represented 
as algebraic terms. Analytic algorithms can be derived by algebraic methods. The main tool in this construction are combinatory models which are inner algebras of Engeler graph models. As an universal domain 
of denotational semantics the lattice structure of the graph models allows to give a striking simple semantics 
for computations with approximations. As models of combinatory algebra they provide all essential computational constructs, including recursion. Combinatory models are constructed as extensions of first order 
theories. The classical first order theory to describe analysis is the theory of differential fields. It turns out 
that two types of computational constructs, namely composition and piecewise definition of functions, are 
preferably introduced as extensions of the differential fields theory. Combinatory differential fields are then 
the combinatory models of these enriched differential fields. We show for basic algorithms of computational 
analysis how their combinatory counterparts are derived in the algebraic setting. We illustrate how these 
algorithms are suitable to be implemented in a computer algebra environment like mathematica.  </abstract>

<title> A Study of Perceptually 
Grounded Polysemy in a Spatial 
Microdomain  </title>
<author> Jordan Zlatev   </author>
<pubnum> TR-92-048  </pubnum>
<date> August 1992  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
This paper attempts to exemplify the advantages of perceptually grounded semantics with respect to traditional formalist approaches in elucidating the nature of the 
controversial notion of linguistic polysemy, or multiplicity of meaning. It is also suggested how some aspects of language typically associated with compositionality could 
be modeled, without there being a strictly "compositional semantics". 
This is done through a series of experiments, using modifications of Terry Regier's 
connectionist system for learning spatial relations [Regier, 1992] which constitutes a 
part of the L 0 project concerned with associating descriptions in an arbitrary language 
with an analog environment, (sequences of) pictures of simple 2-dimensional scenes. 
The emphasis is above all on the English preposition `over', famous for its poly-semy, and analyzed in detail by [Brugman, 1981] and [Lakoff, 1987], but some modeling has been also done of the meaning of `under', as well as some rudimentary 
semantics for simple verbs such as `be', `go' and `fly' that combine with the two 
prepositions.  </abstract>

efficient NC algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a hypergraph 
of dimension greater than 2.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present algorithms for the randomized simulation of a shared memory machine 
(PRAM) on a Distributed Memory Machine (DMM). In a PRAM, memory conflicts 
occur only through concurrent access to the same cell, whereas the memory of a 
DMM is divided into modules, one for each processor, and concurrent accesses to 
the same module create a conflict. The delay of a simulation is the time needed to 
simulate a parallel memory access of the PRAM. Any general simulation of an m 
processor PRAM on a n processor DMM will necessarily have delay at least m=n. A 
randomized simulation is called time-processor optimal if the delay is O(m=n) with 
high probability. Using a novel simulation scheme based on hashing we obtain a 
time-processor optimal simulation with delay O(loglog(n)log (n)). The best previous 
simulations use a simpler scheme based on hashing and have much larger delay: 
fi(log(n)= loglog(n)) for the simulation of an n processor PRAM on an n processor 
DMM, and fi(log(n)) in the case where the simulation is time-processor optimal.  </abstract>

a variety of configurations. Therefore, we try to avoid making hard-wired implicit assumptions 
about design principles and possible scenarios. In order to simplify our analysis, the model 
abstracts away from the physical forces and reasons only about velocities. Nonetheless, it 
succeeds in determining essential features of the motion of the sheet of paper like buckling 
and tearing. The framework provided is quite generic and can be used as a starting point for 
developing models of other transportation domains.  </abstract>

<title> Parallel Sorting With Limited

<author> Micah Adler John W Byers Richard M Karp   </author>
<pubnum> TR-TR-95-031  </pubnum>
<date> July 1995  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
We study the problem of sorting on a parallel computer with limited communication 
bandwidth. By using the recently proposed PRAM(m) model, where p processors 
communicate through a small, globally shared memory consisting of m bits, we focus 
on the trade-off between the amount of local computation and the amount of inter-processor communication required for parallel sorting algorithms. We prove a lower 
bound of ( n log m 
m ) on the time to sort n numbers in an exclusive-read variant of 
the PRAM(m) model. We show that Leighton's Columnsort can be used to give 
an asymptotically matching upper bound in the case where m grows as a fractional 
power of n. The bounds are of a surprising form, in that they have little dependence 
on the parameter p. This implies that attempting to distribute the workload across 
more processors while holding the problem size and the size of the shared memory 
fixed will not improve the optimal running time of sorting in this model. We also 
show that both the upper and the lower bound can be adapted to bridging models 
that address the issue of limited communication bandwidth: the LogP model and 
the BSP model. The lower bounds provide convincing evidence that efficient parallel 
algorithms for sorting rely strongly on high communication bandwidth.  </abstract>

<title> Smoothing and Multiplexing 
Tradeoffs for Deterministic

<abstract> Abstract 
The burstiness of variable bit rate traffic makes it difficult to both efficiently utilize network resources and provide end-to-end network performance guarantees to the traffic sources. 
Generally, smoothing or shaping traffic sources at the entrance of the network reduces their 
burstiness to allow higher utilization within the network. However, this buffering introduces 
an additional delay so that, in effect, lossless smoothing trades queueing delay inside the 
network for smoothing delay at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the net effect 
of smoothing on end-to-end performance guarantees where a no-loss, no-delay-violation deterministic guarantee is provided with the D-BIND traffic model. We analytically quantify 
these tradeoffs and provide a set of general rules for determining under which conditions 
smoothing provides a net gain. We also empirically investigate these tradeoffs using traces 
of MPEG compressed video.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
For slotted networks carrying full multi-media traffic to work successfully, it is essential that connection setup and management is done well under all traffic conditions. 
Major challenges remain with the current state of the technology, however, particularly on how one copes with traffic bursts. Existing reservation-based networks do not 
allow the user to dynamically adjust his bandwidth requirements on demand. In this 
paper we propose a new scheme, called the reservoir scheme, which allows dynamic 
and distributed resource allocation. The basic idea behind the scheme is to reserve 
bandwidth with a guaranteed bit rate for each virtual circuit. The user is allowed to 
decentrally allocate additional bandwidth from an Available Bit Rate (ABR) reservoir to satisfy dynamic changes of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. The duration and 
bandwidth of this dynamic access are negotiated in the call setup phase and do not 
require any renegotiation with the service provider so that this solution overcomes the 
rigidity of current static bandwidth reservation schemes. The additional management 
requirements are low compared to other dynamic bandwidth reservation schemes. We 
also describe an analytic model and simulation which we used to determine whether 
it would be practical to apply the proposed scheme in a slotted network.  </abstract>

<title> A Management Platform for

<email> ulrich@icsi.berkeley.edu  </email>
<pubnum> TR-96-018  </pubnum>
<abstract> Abstract 
Technological progress has made providing numerous new services to large number 
of users possible. Concurrently, we also experience an increased interest in real-time 
and interactive applications, e. g. teleseminaring, video conferencing and application 
sharing, in particular, because of the worldwide and decentralized character of today's 
research and development organizations. 
The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) is a participant of the first 
transatlantic ATM link which is an integral part of the Multimedia Applications 
on Intercontinental Highways (MAY) Project. Additionally, ICSI is attached to the 
Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) providing ATM connectivity at the best-effort 
basis. Both projects provide platforms to identify the key research and development 
topics in cooperative real-time communication. 
The technical report gives a brief introduction to the ATM infrastructure at ICSI and 
addresses challenging management issues of multimedia applications in such global 
area ATM networks. We explore three management areas: performance, configuration, 
and fault management with respect to the user's point of view. Finally, we introduce 
a management platform and tools we have been developing which help the user to

<abstract> Abstract 
At the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), there is an ongoing effort 
to gain experience on ATM and multi-media applications. ICSI is participating in 
two ATM pilots called Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) and Multimedia Applications on Intercontinental Highway (MAY). Beside these wide-area trial ICSI's 
ATM network is used for local multi-media experiments. The ATM environment at 
ICSI is heterogeneous. Both, local and long distance traffic is based on permanent 
virtual connections. The management of this environment has often been cumbersome and time-consuming for a number of reasons: The ATM devices have to be 
accessed separately in an unintegrated manner. Different vendor-specific tools with 
different user interfaces are used. Configuration data is stored unstructured, redundant and not centralized. Users cannot setup or verify a connection without knowing 
device-specific details. Hence, the need for a software tool arose that can minimize the 
administrative work spent on connection management. This technical report contains 
my master's thesis which is about the design and implementation of TOMCAD a 
tool for monitoring and configuration of ATM devices. Being a web-based software 
tool it can support local and wide-area connectivity and provide access for local and 
remote users.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We consider the problem of scheduling permanent jobs on related machines in an 
on-line fashion. We design a new algorithm that achieves the competitive ratio of 3 + 
p 
8 5:828 for the deterministic version, and 3:31= ln 2:155 4:311 for its randomized 
variant, improving the previous competitive ratios of 8 and 2e 5:436. We also prove 
lower bounds of 2:4380 on the competitive ratio of deterministic algorithms and 1:8372 
on the competitive ratio of randomized algorithms for this problem.  </abstract>

We have introduced concurrency into the framework of Sandewall. The resulting formalism is capable of reasoning about interdependent as well 
as independent concurrent actions. Following 
Sandewall's systematical method, we have then 
applied the entailment criterion PCM to selecting 
intended models of common sense theories where 
concurrent actions are allowed, and proved that 
the criterion leads to only intended models for a 
subset of such theories.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. We use simulated soccer to study multiagent learning. Each 
team's players (agents) share action set and policy but may behave differently due to position-dependent inputs. All agents making up a team 
are rewarded or punished collectively in case of goals. We conduct simulations with varying team sizes, and compare two learning algorithms: 
TD-Q learning with linear neural networks (TD-Q) and Probabilistic 
Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE). TD-Q is based on evaluation 
functions (EFs) mapping input/action pairs to expected reward, while 
PIPE searches policy space directly. PIPE uses an adaptive probability 
distribution to synthesize programs that calculate action probabilities 
from current inputs. Our results show that TD-Q has difficulties to learn 
appropriate shared EFs. PIPE, however, does not depend on EFs and 
finds good policies faster and more reliably.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Two key issues for induction algorithms are the accuracy of the learned hypothesis and the computational 
resources consumed in inducing that hypothesis. One 
of the most promising ways to improve performance 
along both dimensions is to make use of additional 
knowledge. Multi-strategy learning algorithms tackle 
this problem by employing several strategies for handling different kinds of knowledge in different ways. 
However, integrating knowledge into an induction algorithm can be difficult when the new knowledge differs significantly from the knowledge the algorithm 
already uses. In many cases the algorithm must be 
rewritten. 
This paper presents KII, a Knowledge Integration 
framework for Induction, that provides a uniform 
mechanism for integrating knowledge into induction. 
In theory, arbitrary knowledge can be integrated with 
this mechanism, but in practice the knowledge representation language determines both the knowledge 
that can be integrated, and the costs of integration 
and induction. By instantiating KII with various set 
representations, algorithms can be generated at different trade-off points along these dimensions. 
One instantiation of KII, called RS-KII, is presented 
that can implement hybrid induction algorithms, depending on which knowledge it utilizes. RS-KII is 
demonstrated to implement AQ-11 (Michalski 1978), 
as well as a hybrid algorithm that utilizes a domain 
theory and noisy examples. Other algorithms are also 
possible.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: A Hybrid Intelligent Architecture that aims to exploit the complementary features of 
expert systems and connectionist architecture, is proposed to revise input characterization and initial 
domain knowledge. HIA has two building blocks, a Rule-Based module and a Connectionist Architecture 
module. A specific format for the rule-based description of the initial theory acquired from the application 
domain enables its mapping into a uniform, three layer network. Continuous inputs are discretized into 
input vectors using a new coarse coding scheme. An extension of the Backpropagation Algorithm allows 
refinement of the discretization functions. A successful application to the control of dams on the Colorado 
river near Austin, is described.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Genetic Programming is applied to the task of 
evolving general iterative sorting algorithms. A 
connection between size and generality was discovered. Adding inverse size to the fitness measure along with correctness not only decreases 
the size of the resulting evolved algorithms, but 
also dramatically increases their generality and 
thus the effectiveness of the evolution process. In 
addition, a variety of differing problem formulations are investigated and the relative probability 
of success for each is reported. An example of an 
evolved sort from each problem formulation is 
presented, and an initial attempt is made to 
understand the variations in difficulty resulting 
from these differing problem formulations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes an efficient optimistic concurrency control 
scheme for use in distributed database systems in which objects are 
cached and manipulated at client machines while persistent storage 
and transactional support are provided by servers. The scheme 
provides both serializability and external consistency for committed 
transactions; it uses loosely synchronized clocks to achieve global 
serialization. It stores only a single version of each object, and 
avoids maintaining any concurrency control information on a per- 
object basis; instead, it tracks recent invalidations on a per-client 
basis, an approach that has low in-memory space overhead and no 
per-object disk overhead. In addition to its low space overheads, 
the scheme also performs well. The paper presents a simulation 
study that compares the scheme to adaptive callback locking, the 
best concurrency control scheme for client-server object-oriented 
database systems studied to date. The study shows that our 
scheme outperforms adaptive callback locking for low to moderate 
contention workloads, and scales better with the number of clients. 
For high contention workloads, optimism can result in a high abort 
rate; the scheme presented here is a first step toward a hybrid scheme 
that we expect to perform well across the full range of workloads.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A non-greedy approach for constructing globally optimal 
multivariate decision trees with fixed structure is proposed. Previous greedy tree construction algorithms are 
locally optimal in that they optimize some splitting criterion at each decision node, typically one node at a time. 
In contrast, global tree optimization explicitly considers 
all decisions in the tree concurrently. An iterative linear 
programming algorithm is used to minimize the classification error of the entire tree. Global tree optimization 
can be used both to construct decision trees initially and 
to update existing decision trees. Encouraging computational experience is reported.  </abstract>

Generating language that reflects the temporal organization of represented knowledge requires a language generation model that integrates contemporary theories of tense and aspect, temporal representations, and methods 
to plan text. This paper presents a model 
that produces complex sentences that reflect

is the successful application of constrained linguistic theories of tense and aspect to a generator which produces meaningful event combinations and selects appropriate connecting words 
that relate them.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. In this paper we present one aspect of our research on machine translation (MT): 
capturing the grammatical and computational relation between (i) the interlingua (IL) as defined 
declaratively in the lexicon and (ii) the IL as defined procedurally by way of algorithms that 
compose and decompose pivot IL forms. We begin by examining the interlinguas in the lexicons of 
a variety of current IL-based approaches to MT. This brief survey makes it clear that no consensus 
exists among MT researchers on the level of representation for defining the IL. In the section that 
follows, we explore the consequences of this missing formal framework for MT system builders who 
develop their own lexical-IL entries. The lack of software tools to support rapid IL respecification 
and testing greatly hampers their ability to modify representations to handle new data and new 
domains. Our view is that IL-based MT research needs both (a) the formal framework to specify 
possible IL grammars and (b) the software support tools to implement and test these grammars. 
With respect to (a), we propose adopting a lexicalized grammar approach, tapping research 
results from the study of tree grammars for natural language syntax. With respect to (b), we 
sketch the design and functional specifications for parts of ILustrate, the set of software tools 
that we need to implement and test the various IL formalisms that meet the requirements of a 
lexicalized grammar. In this way, we begin to address a basic issue in MT research, how to define 
and test an interlingua as a computational language | without building a full MT system for 
each possible IL formalism that might be proposed.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. The application of Machine Learning techniques to multimedia and multimodal systems, 
resp., seems to be a promising approach in order to enhance the systems' capabilities. Especially 
in multimodal systems which support human-computer interaction (HCI) via several input/output 
channels in parallel, intelligent mechanisms are needed in order to process the user's inputs and to 
select the best output modality. 
In this paper, we will deal with a multi-agent system which introduces some kind of haptic feedback 
to the user interface. The main task of the system is to predict the next user action in order to launch 
the haptic feedback selectively and to adapt this capability over time to both, the user's behavior 
and the application's user interface structure. Therefore, a statistical interaction model is generated 
and managed based on stochastic classification methods.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of scheduling two classes of real-time traffic with correlated time constraints 
is considered. Three scheduling disciplines are studied: a priority discipline which gives strict 
priority to one class of traffic, a threshold-based scheme in which priority is given to one class 
of traffic when the minimum laxity of its queued packets falls below some threshold, and a 
"balancing" scheme which assigns priority on the basis of the differences in minimum laxities in 
the two classes of traffic. Analytic results are obtained by using a discrete time model to obtain 
the state occupancy probabilities for the system. Here, the state is defined using the laxities of 
the queued real time packets. Parameters are defined to study the tradeoff in the performance 
of the two classes of traffic. Results are obtained to demonstrate how the balancing scheme 
permits us to achieve significant improvement in the performance of one class of traffic with 
only minimal effect on the performance of other class. A video application is suggested for this 
work.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service network remains a challenging research problem. Most 
protocols for reliable multicast use repair techniques that result in significant and variable delay, which can lead to 
missed deadlines in real-time scenarios. This paper presents a repair technique that combines forward error correction 
(FEC) with automatic repeat request (ARQ). The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to reduce delay in reliable 
multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively (i.e., before they are required). The technique requires minimal 
state at senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality beyond what is required by the current 
multicast service model. Furthermore, the technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all data and repairs are 
transmitted by the data-originating source, leaving receivers free from any burden of sending repairs. We simulate 
a simple round-based version of a protocol embodying this technique to show its effectiveness in preventing repair 
request implosion, reducing the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping bandwidth usage for repairs 
low. We show how a protocol using the technique can be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time 
deadline with probabilities extremely close to one. Finally, we develop several variations of the protocol that use the 
technique in various fashions for high rate data streaming applications, and present results from additional simulations 
that examine performance in a variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Techniques for avoiding the high memory overheads found on 
many modern shared-memory multiprocessors are of increasing 
importance in the development of high-performance multiprocessor protocol implementations. One such technique is processor-cache affinity scheduling, which can significantly lower packet 
latency and substantially increase protocol processing throughput 
[20]. In this paper, we evaluate several aspects of the effectiveness of affinity-based scheduling in multiprocessor network 
protocol processing, under packet-level and connection-level par-allelization approaches. Specifically, we evaluate the performance 
of the scheduling technique 1) when a large number of streams are 
concurrently supported, 2) when processing includes copying of 
uncached packet data, 3) as applied to send-side protocol processing, and 4) in the presence of stream burstiness and source locality, two well-known properties of network traffic. We find that 
affinity-based scheduling performs well under these conditions, 
emphasizing its robustness and general effectiveness in multiprocessor network processing. In addition, we explore a technique 
which improves the caching behavior and available packet-level 
concurrency under connection-level parallelism, and find performance improves dramatically.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The loss probability of a queueing system provides, in many cases, insufficient information for performance evaluation, for example, of data link layer protocols and applications with forward 
error correction. 
This paper evaluates and characterizes the correlation between packet losses for two queueing systems in discrete time 
that are motivated by BISDN applications. The first, a two-class discrete-time queueing system, approximates the output 
queue of an ATM switch. The queue serves periodic foreground 
traffic and random background traffic. The background traffic 
is modeled as i.i.d. batches of arbitrary distribution. It is shown 
that the conditional loss probability (CLP) is independent of the 
buffer size if the buffer size is at least as large as the period of 
the foreground traffic. Example calculations indicate that losses 
occur essentially randomly as long as the foreground traffic uses 
less than 10% of the channel capacity. 
The second analysis derives the CLP seen by a selected 
stream in a slotted finite-buffer system with a superposition of 
interrupted Poisson sources. Here, the total number of arrivals 
may be correlated from slot to slot. Traffic correlation is seen 
to have a strong influence on loss correlation, while buffer size 
is seen to have virtually none.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a 
high speed network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward 
reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. 
We present two basic results. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in 
rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish 
the optimality of our optimal smoothing approach, and illustrate its performance over a set of 
long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the 
network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: Deterministic 
Guaranteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. Under both models, we 
find the impact of optimal smoothing to be dramatic.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Domain or background knowledge is often needed in order 
to solve difficult problems of learning medical diagnostic rules. Earlier 
experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge 
when learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. A particular form of background knowledge comprising typical co-occurrences 
of several groups of attributes was provided by a medical expert. This 
paper explores the possibility to automate the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set 
of attributes. The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co-occurrences it identifies, as well as their contribution to the performance 
of machine learning algorithms, to the ones provided by a medical expert.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Massively parallel processors have begun using commodity operating systems that support demand-paged 
virtual memory. To evaluate the utility of virtual 
memory, we measured the behavior of seven shared-memory parallel application programs on a simulated 
distributed-shared-memory machine. Our results (i) 
confirm the importance of gang CPU scheduling, (ii) 
show that a page-faulting processor should spin rather 
than invoke a parallel context switch, (iii) show that 
our parallel programs frequently touch most of their 
data, and (iv) indicate that memory, not just CPUs, 
must be "gang scheduled". Overall, our experiments 
demonstrate that demand paging has limited value 
on current parallel machines because of the applications' synchronization and memory reference patterns 
and the machines' high page-fault and parallel-context-switch overheads.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes how a runtime support library can be used as compiler runtime 
support in irregular applications. The CHAOS runtime support library carries out 
optimizations designed to reduce communication costs by performing software caching, 
communication coalescing and inspector/executor preprocessing. CHAOS also supplies 
special purpose routines to support specific types of irregular reduction and runtime 
support for partitioning data and work between processors. A number of adaptive 
irregular codes have been parallelized using the CHAOS library and performance results 
from these codes are also presented in this paper.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents methods that make it possible to efficiently support irregular problems using data 
parallel languages. The approach involves the use of a portable, compiler-independent, runtime support 
library called CHAOS. The CHAOS runtime support library contains procedures that 
* support static and dynamic distributed array partitioning, 
* partition loop iterations and indirection arrays, 
* remap arrays from one distribution to another, and 
* carry out index translation, buffer allocation and communication schedule generation. 
The CHAOS runtime procedures are used by a prototype Fortran 90D compiler as runtime support for irregular problems. This paper also presents performance results of compiler-generated and 
hand-parallelized versions of two stripped down applications codes. The first code is derived from 
an unstructured mesh computational fluid dynamics flow solver and the second is derived from the 
molecular dynamics code CHARMM. 
A method is described that makes it possible to emulate irregular distributions in HPF by reordering elements of data arrays and renumbering indirection arrays. The results suggest that an HPF 
compiler could use reordering and renumbering extrinsic functions to obtain performance comparable 
to that achieved by a compiler for a language (such as Fortran 90D) that directly supports irregular 
distributions.  </abstract>

offers possibilities to overcome this difficulty. It is shown that networks

<abstract> Abstract 
The concept of a fitness formula as a property of an organism is proposed. In 
artificial life simulations with organisms living in an environment, the fitness formula 
can be interpreted as the ability of organisms to extract energy from potential food 
sources distributed in the environment. In simulations where the goal of the genetic 
algorithm is that of developing systems which exhibit a certain type of behavior in a 
particular environment, the fitness formula becomes an independent variable which can 
be manipulated in order to obtain the desired behavior. The fitness formula can be 
viewed as an evolvable trait of organisms, and therefore not fixed and decided by the 
researcher. Simulations with fixed and evolvable fitness formulae show that the fitness 
formula, the sensory apparatus, and the behavior of organisms may co-evolve and be 
co-adapted.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper advocates the idea that the physical modularity (file structure) of application components supported by conventional OS environments can be elevated to the level of logical modularity, which in turn 
can directly support application development in an 
object-oriented manner. We demonstrate this idea 
through a system-wide server that manages the manipulation of such components effectively. The server 
is designed to be a fundamental operating system service responsible for binding and mapping component 
instances into client address spaces. 
We show how this model solves some longstanding 
problems with the management of application components in existing application development environments. We demonstrate that this model's effectiveness derives from its support for the cornerstones of 
OO programming: classes and their instances, encapsulation, and several forms of inheritance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we introduce a general method for Bayesian computing in richly-parameterized 
models, Structured Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC), that is based on a blocked hybrid of the 
Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. SMCMC speeds algorithm convergence by 
using the structure that is present in the problem to suggest an appropriate Metropolis-Hastings 
candidate distribution. While the approach is easiest to describe for hierarchical normal linear 
models, we show its extension to both non-normal and nonlinear cases to be straightforward. 
After describing the method in detail we compare its performance (both in terms of runtime and 
autocorrelation in the samples produced) to several other existing methods, including the traditional 
single-site updating Gibbs sampler available in the popular BUGS software package. Our results 
suggest significant improvements in convergence for many problems using SMCMC, as well as 
broad applicability of the method, including previously intractable hierarchical nonlinear model 
settings.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packet-switching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation 
and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource 
management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dynamics of the communicating clients; 
(b) the dynamics of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting 
the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate 
as many real-time clients as possible, while flexibility is the ability to adapt the real-time services to changing network state 
and client demands. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme, which addresses these 
issues by providing the network with the capability to dynamically modify the performance parameters and the routes of 
any existing real-time connection. With these capabilities, DCM can be used to increase the availability and flexibility of 
the guaranteed performance service offered to the clients.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We examine the estimation of selectivities for range and spatial join queries in real spatial 
databases. As we have shown earlier [FK94a], real point sets: (a) violate consistently the 
"uniformity" and "independence" assumptions, (b) can often be described as "fractals", with 
non-integer (fractal) dimension. In this paper we show that, among the infinite family of fractal 
dimensions, the so called "Correlation Dimension" D 2 is the one that we need to predict the 
selectivity of spatial join. 
The main contribution is that, for all the real and synthetic point-sets we tried, the average 
number of neighbors for a given point of the point-set follows a power law, with D 2 as the exponent. This immediately solves the selectivity estimation for spatial joins, as well as for "biased" 
range queries (i.e., queries whose centers prefer areas of high point density). 
We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for the biased queries, including an integration constant (K `shape 0 ) for each query shape. Finally, we show results on real and synthetic 
point sets, where our formulas achieve very low relative errors (typically about 10%, versus 
40%-100% of the uniform assumption).  </abstract>

<title> Probabilistic Independence Networks for Hidden 
Markov Probability Models  </title>
<author> Padhraic Smyth, David Heckerman, and Michael Jordan  </author>
A<abstract> bstract 
Graphical techniques for modeling the dependencies of random variables have been explored in a variety 
of different areas including statistics, statistical physics, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, image 
processing, and genetics. Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively 
independently in these research communities. In this paper we explore hidden Markov models (HMMs) 
and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence networks (PINs). The 
paper contains a self-contained review of the basic principles of PINs. It is shown that the well-known 
forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference 
algorithms for arbitrary PINs. Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for 
more general graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish to explore 
a richer class of HMM structures. Examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and 
coarticulation in speech recognition are introduced and treated within the graphical model framework 
to illustrate the advantages of the general approach.  </abstract>

and manage large information network. In this 
report, various techniques for displaying depth 
information are reviewed, with an emphasis on 
stereoscopic displays. Input devices used to interact with a 3-D space are also examined. Issues in 3-D network visualisation are elicited from 
three viewpoints: psychological, task-related and 
implementational. Consideration of these issues 
leads to the design of a preliminary experimental 
programme for evaluating various network visu-alisation techniques.  </abstract>

<title> Networks and the Best Approximation Property  </title>
<author> Federico Girosi and Tomaso Poggio  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
Networks can be considered as approximation schemes. Multilayer networks of the 
backpropagation type can approximate arbitrarily well continuous functions (Cybenko, 
1989; Funahashi, 1989; Stinchcombe and White, 1989). We prove that networks derived from regularization theory and including Radial Basis Functions (Poggio and 
Girosi, 1989), have a similar property. From the point of view of approximation theory, however, the property of approximating continuous functions arbitrarily well is not 
sufficient for characterizing good approximation schemes. More critical is the property 
of best approximation. The main result of this paper is that multilayer networks, of the 
type used in backpropagation, are not best approximation. For regularization networks 
(in particular Radial Basis Function networks) we prove existence and uniqueness of 
best approximation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Programmers using imperative languages have a number of well-established debugging tools available to them; functional programmers have few, if any, tools available. 
Many of the tools and techniques developed for debugging functional programs are 
based on those for imperative programming and lack a theoretical basis relevant to 
functional programming. In addition, the techniques used are typically very time-consuming. A theoretical foundation on which to base the study of errors and debugging in functional programming is presented in this report. Using this theoretical 
foundation, a set of program transformation schemes has been developed which facilitate the location of the type of error which results in an evaluation-time error message 
and the termination of evaluation. A brief description of the practical experience ob 
tained using the tool is also presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Communication in real-time systems has to be predictable, because unpredictable delays in 
the delivery of messages can adversely affect the execution of tasks dependent on these messages. 
In this paper, we develop a scheme for providing predictable inter-process communication in 
real-time systems with (partially connected) point-to-point interconnection networks, which 
provides guarantees on the maximum delivery time for messages. This scheme is based on the 
concept of a real-time channel, a unidirectional connection between source and destination. A 
real-time channel has parameters which describe the performance requirements of the source-destination communication, e.g., from a sensor station to a control site. Once such a channel 
is established, the communications subsystem guarantees that these performance requirements 
will be met. In this paper, we concentrate on methods to compute guarantees for the delivery time of messages belonging to real-time channels. We also address problems associated 
with allocating buffers for these messages and develop a scheme which preserves delivery time 
guarantees.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Designers of embedded systems are facing ever tighter 
constraints on design time, but computer aided design tools 
for embedded systems have not kept pace with these trends. 
The Chinook co-synthesis system addresses the automation of the most time-consuming and error-prone tasks in 
embedded controller design, namely: the synthesis of interface hardware and software needed to integrate system 
components; the migration of functions between processors 
or custom logic; and the co-simulation of the design before, 
during, and after synthesis. This paper describes the principal elements of Chinook and discuss its application to a 
variety of embedded designs.  </abstract>

<title> Dispersion Analysis of Numerical Wave Propagation 
and its Computational Consequences  </title>
<author> Alain Sei and William Symes   </author>
<note> (Submitted to the Journal of Scientific Computing)  </note>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present in this paper a comparison of the dispersion properties for several finite-difference approximations of the acoustic wave equation. We investigate the compact and 
staggered schemes of fourth order accuracy in space and of second order or fourth order accuracy in time. We derive the computational cost of the simulation implied by a precision 
criterion on the numerical simulation (maximum allowed error in phase or group velocity). 
We conclude that for moderate accuracy the staggered scheme of second order in time is more 
efficient, whereas for very precise simulation the compact scheme of fourth order in time is 
a better choice. The comparison increasingly favors the lower order staggered scheme as the 
dimension increases. In three dimensional simulation, the cost of extremely precise simulation with any of the schemes is very large, whereas for simulation of moderate precision the 
staggered scheme is the least expensive.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Two trust-region interior-point algorithms for the solution of minimization problems 
with simple bounds are presented. The algorithms scale the local model in a way proposed 
by Coleman and Li [1], but they are new otherwise. The first algorithm is more usual in 
that the trust region and the local quadratic model are consistently scaled. The second 
algorithm proposed here uses an unscaled trust region. A first-order convergence result for 
these algorithms is given and dogleg and conjugate-gradient algorithms to compute trial 
steps are introduced. Some numerical examples that show the advantages of the the second 
algorithm are presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We analyze a space-time domain decomposition iteration, for a model advection 
diffusion equation in one and two dimensions. The asymptotic convergence rate is 
superlinear, and it is governed by the diffusion of the error across the overlap between 
subdomains. Hence, it depends on both the size of this overlap and the diffusion 
coefficient in the equation. However, it is independent of the number of subdomains. 
The convergence rate for the heat equation in a large time window is initially linear and 
it deteriorates as the number of subdomains increases. The duration of the transient 
linear regime is proportional to the length of the time window. For advection dominated 
problems, the convergence rate is initially linear and it improves as the the ratio of 
advection to diffusion increases. Moreover, it is independent of the size of the time 
window and of the number of subdomains. In two space dimensions, the iteration 
possesses the smoothing property: high modes of the error are damped much faster 
then low modes. This is a result of the natural smoothing property of the heat equation. 
Numerical calculations illustrate our analysis.  </abstract>

This paper discusses a method for training multilayer 
perceptron networks called DMP2 (Dynamic Multilayer 
Perceptron 2). The method is based upon a divide and conquer 
approach which builds networks in the form of binary trees, 
dynamically allocating nodes and layers as needed. The focus 
of this paper is on the effects of using multiple node types 
within the DMP framework. Simulation results show that 
DMP2 performs favorably in comparison with other learning 
algorithms, and that using multiple node types can be 
beneficial to network performance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. This paper presents an inductive learning system called the Genetic Instance-Based 
Learning (GIBL) system. This system combines instance-based learning approaches with 
evolutionary computation in order to achieve high accuracy in the presence of irrelevant or 
redundant attributes. Evolutionary computation is used to find a set of attribute weights that 
yields a high estimate of classification accuracy. Results of experiments on 16 data sets are 
shown, and are compared with a non-weighted version of the instance-based learning system. 
The results indicate that the generalization accuracy of GIBL is somewhat higher than that of the 
non-weighted system on regular data, and is significantly higher on data with irrelevant or 
redundant attributes.  </abstract>

<title> Incremental Cryptography and Application to Virus Protection  </title>
<author> Mihir Bellare Oded Goldreich Shafi Goldwasser   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
The goal of incremental cryptography is to design cryptographic algorithms with the property that having applied 
the algorithm to a document, it is possible to quickly update 
the result of the algorithm for a modified document, rather 
than having to re-compute it from scratch. In settings where 
cryptographic algorithms such as encryption or signatures 
are frequently applied to changing documents, dramatic efficiency improvements can be achieved. One such setting is 
the use of authentication tags for virus protection. 
We consider documents that can be modified by powerful (and realistic) document modification operations such as 
insertion and deletion of character-strings (or equivalently 
cut and paste of text). We provide efficient incremental 
signature and message authentication schemes supporting 
the above document modification operations. They meet a 
strong notion of tamper-proof security which is appropriate 
for the virus protection setting. We initiate a study of incremental encryption, providing definitions as well as solutions. 
Finally, we raise the novel issue of "privacy" of incremental 
authentication schemes.  </abstract>

<author> Oded Goldreich Noam Nisan Avi Wigderson x  </author>
<date> March 1995 (corrected Dec. 1995 and March 1998)  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
A fundamental Lemma of Yao states that computational weak-unpredictability 
of functions gets amplified if the results of several independent instances are XOR 
together. We survey two known proofs of Yao's Lemma and present a third alternative proof. The third proof proceeds by first proving that a function constructed 
by concatenating the values of the function on several independent instances is much 
more unpredictable, with respect to specified complexity bounds, than the original 
function. This statement turns out to be easier to prove than the XOR-Lemma. 
Using a result of Goldreich and Levin and some elementary observation, we derive 
the XOR-Lemma.  </abstract>

<title> Eventually-Serializable Data Services  </title>
<author> Alan Fekete David Gupta Victor Luchangco Nancy Lynch Alex Shvartsman   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present a new specification for distributed data services that trade-off immediate consistency guarantees 
for improved system availability and efficiency, while 
ensuring the long-term consistency of the data. An 
eventually-serializable data service maintains the operations requested in a partial order that gravitates over 
time towards a total order. It provides clear and unambiguous guarantees about the immediate and long-term 
behavior of the system. To demonstrate its utility, we 
present an algorithm, based on one of Ladin, Liskov, 
Shrira, and Ghemawat [12], that implements this specification. Our algorithm provides the interface of the 
abstract service, and generalizes their algorithm by allowing general operations and greater flexibility in specifying consistency requirements. We also describe how 
to use this specification as a building block for applications such as directory services.  </abstract>

<title> Incoercible Multiparty Computation  </title>
<note> (Extended Abstract)   </note>
<author> Ran Canetti Rosario Gennaro   </author>
<date> May 17, 1996  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
Current secure multiparty protocols have the following deficiency. The public transcript of the communication can be used as an involuntary commitment of the parties to their inputs and outputs. Thus 
parties can be later coerced by some authority to reveal their private data. Previous work that has 
pointed this interesting problem out contained only partial treatment. 
In this work we present the first general and rigorous treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. First we present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Our 
definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty 
protocols. Next we show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly 
computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of com-putationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less 
than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, ours are the first incoercible protocols 
without physical assumptions. Also, our protocols constitute an alternative solution to the recently 
solved adaptive security problem. 
Our techniques are quite surprising and include non-standard use of deniable encryptions.  </abstract>

<title> Proactive RSA  </title>
<author> Yair Frankel Peter Gemmell Philip D. MacKenzie Moti Yung x  </author>
<date> August 4, 1996  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
The notion of "proactive security" of basic primitives and cryptosystems that are distributed 
amongst various servers, was introduced in order to tolerate a very strong "mobile adversary." This 
adversary may corrupt all participants throughout the lifetime of the system in a non-monotonic 
fashion (i.e. recoveries are possible) but the adversary is unable to corrupt too many participants 
during any short time period [OstrovskyYung]. The notion assures increased security and availability 
of the cryptographic primitive. 
We present a proactive RSA system in which a threshold of servers applies the RSA signature 
(or decryption) function in a distributed manner; RSA is perhaps the most important trapdoor 
function in use. Employing new combinatorial and elementary number theoretic techniques, our 
protocol enables the dynamic updating of the servers (which hold the RSA key distributively); 
it is secure even when a linear number of the servers are corrupted during any time period (linear 
redundancy); it efficiently "self-maintains" the security of the function and its messages (ciphertexts 
or signatures); and it enables continuous availability, namely, correct function application using the 
shared key is possible at any time. 
We present an efficient way in which l servers can share an RSA private function so that, given 
0 &lt; &lt; t &lt; 1: 
* Proactive (Dynamic) Robustness: A gateway G can combine information from any set of lt 
(honest) servers to deduce the RSA signature for any authorized message at any period. 
* Proactive Security (against mobile adversary): Our protocol is secure against a polynomial 
time adversary who controls the gateway G and time-variant sets of up to minfl(1 t ); lg 
servers, and can obtain the shares of up to l servers (including those that it corrupts). 
* Uniform Boundedness: The share-size is always bounded by the size of an RSA private key 
(i.e., logarithmically in N ). 
We also present special practical instances based on designs; some of these instances were recently 
implemented as part of a highly secure application testbed at Sandia National Laboratories. 
A major technical difficulty in "proactivizing" RSA was the fact that the servers have to update 
the "distributed representation" of an RSA key, while not learning the order of the group from 
which keys are drawn (in order not to compromise the RSA security).  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A unified, comprehensive presentation of simulation techniques for verification of concurrent systems is given, in terms of a simple untimed automaton model. In particular, 
(1) refinements, (2) forward and backward simulations, (3) hybrid forward-backward 
and backward-forward simulations, and (4) history and prophecy relations are defined. 
History and prophecy relations are abstract versions of the history and prophecy variables of Abadi and Lamport, as well as the auxiliary variables of Owicki and Gries. 
Relationships between the different types of simulations, as well as soundness and 
completeness results, are stated and proved. Finally, it is shown how invariants can be 
incorporated into all the simulations. 
Even though many results are presented here for the first time, this paper can 
also be read as a survey (in a simple setting) of the research literature on simulation 
techniques. 
The development for untimed automata is designed to support a similar development for timed automata. In Part II of this paper, it is shown how the results of this 
paper can be carried over to the setting of timed automata.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Previous efforts at facial expression recognition have 
been based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a 
representation developed in order to allow human psychologists to code expression from static facial mugshots. In 
this paper we develop new, more accurate representations 
for facial expression by building a video database of facial 
expressions and then probabilistically characterizing the 
facial muscle activation associated with each expression 
using a detailed physical model of the skin and muscles. 
This produces a muscle-based representation of facial motion, which is then used to recognize facial expressions in 
two different ways. The first method uses the physics-based 
model directly, by recognizing expressions through comparison of estimated muscle activations. The second method 
uses the physics-based model to generate spatio-temporal 
motion-energy templates of the whole face for each different 
expression. These simple, biologically-plausible motion 
energy templates are then used for recognition. Both 
methods show substantially greater accuracy at expression 
recognition than has been previously achieved.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A thesaurus is a book containing synonyms in a 
given language; it provides similarity links when 
trying to retrieve articles or stories about a particular topic. A "visual thesaurus" works with 
pictures, not words. It aids in recognizing visually similar events, "visual synonyms," including 
both spatial and motion similarity. This paper

of the method is a learning system which gathers information by interacting with a user of a 
database. The learning system is also capable of 
incorporating audio and other perceptual information, ultimately constructing a representation

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a person identification technique that 
can recognize and verify people from unconstrained 
video and audio. We do not expect fully frontal face 
image or clean speech as our input. Our recognition algorithm can detect and compensate for pose variation 
and changes in the auditory background and also select the most reliable video frame and audio clip to use 
for recognition. We also use 3D depth information of 
a human head to detect the presence of an actual person as opposed to an image of that person. Our system achieves 100% recognition and verification rates 
on natural real-time input with 26 registered clients.  </abstract>

<title> Building Query Optimizers with Combinators:  </title>
<note> Dissertation Proposal  </note>
<author> Mitch Cherniack  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
Query optimizers generate plans to retrieve data specified by queries. Query optimization 
for object databases (i.e., object-oriented and object-relational databases) is an immature field, 
and stands to benefit from adaptation of techniques that have proved useful for relations. One 
technique uses query-to-query transformations to rewrite queries into queries that are potentially 
more amenable to plan generation. For transformations to be useful, they must preserve the 
semantics of the queries they rewrite (correctness) and usually result in queries that generate 
better plans (effectiveness). Object databases complicate the expression of correct and effective 
transformations. 
Transformation correctness is problematic even for relational queries. Especially error-prone 
are transformations that rewrite complex nested queries (queries containing other queries) or 
queries that return duplicates. Objects make correctness more difficult because object queries 
can be far more complex than relational queries. 
The effectiveness of a relational transformation typically depends on the syntax of a query 
rather than the semantics of of its data or functions. On the other hand, the lack of uniformity 
in data functions and collections in an object query makes effectiveness more subtle. The effectiveness of a transformation for object queries may depend on the semantics of data functions, 
and may vary from object to object in a collection. Therefore, optimizers may have to perform 
sophisticated reasoning and apply transformations on a per object basis to ensure that they are 
used only when appropriate. 
This thesis considers the correctness and effectiveness of optimizer transformations. To 
address correctness, we propose a formally specified query algebra and two-tiered language 
(COKO-KOLA) for expressing transformations that can be verified with a theorem prover. To 
address effectiveness, we propose semantic and dynamic extensions to the traditional optimizer 
architecture. The high-level contribution of the thesis is the observation that the choice of 
query representation impacts the quality of the optimizer. Specifically, a combinator-based 
(variable-free) query representation simplifies the query manipulations that are required to make 
transformations correct and effective.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Shape recognition is a challenging task when images contain overlapping, noisy, occluded, partial shapes. 
This paper addresses the task of matching input shapes with model shapes described in terms of features 
such as line segments and angles. The quality of matching is gauged using a measure derived from attributed 
shape grammars. We apply genetic algorithms to the partial shape-matching task. Preliminary results, using 
model shapes with 6 to 70 features each, are extremely encouraging.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents some of the underlying principles of description logics (also known 
as terminological logics or kl-one-style languages), grounding them in the lattice of terms 
organized by the so-called "subsumption" relationship. A survey of the increasingly varied uses 
of description logics, including industrial applications, is presented by considering their role in 
a number of different operations that one can apply to a knowledge base, including languages 
for queries, answers, updates, rules, and constraints. Finally, we discuss some of the complexity 
results related to the logics of descriptions, and survey a spectrum of responses to the many 
intractability proofs.  </abstract>

Given a permutation P of f1; : : : ; kg and T of f1; : : : ; ng, the pattern matching problem for per

for finding a match of P into T or determining that no match exists, given that P is separable, i.e. 
contains neither (2, 4, 1, 3) nor (3, 1, 4, 2) as a subpattern.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Simplicial depth is a way to measure how deep a point is among a set of points. Efficient 
algorithms to compute it are important to the usefulness of its applications, such as in 
multivariate analysis in statistics. A straightforward method takes O(n d+1 ) time when the 
points are in d-dimensional space. We discuss an algorithm that takes O(n 2 ) time when the 
points are in three-dimensional space, and we generalize it to four-dimensional space with 
a time complexity of O(n 4 ). For spaces higher than four-dimensional, there are no known 
algorithms faster than the straightforward method.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents an efficient algorithm for constructing Bayesian belief networks from databases. The 
algorithm takes a database and an attributes ordering (i.e., the causal attributes of an attribute should appear earlier 
in the order) as input and constructs a belief network structure as output. The construction process is based on the 
computation of mutual information of attribute pairs. Given a data set which is large enough and has a DAG-Isomorphic probability distribution, this algorithm guarantees that the perfect map [1] of the underlying dependency 
model is generated, and at the same time, enjoys the time complexity of O N( ) 2 on conditional independence (CI) 
tests. To evaluate this algorithm, we present the experimental results on three versions of the well-known ALARM 
network database, which has 37 attributes and 10,000 records. The correctness proof and the analysis of 
computational complexity are also presented. We also discuss the features of our work and relate it to previous 
works.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Large-scale parallel machines are incorporating increasingly sophisticated architectural support for user-level messaging and global memory access. We provide a systematic 
evaluation of a broad spectrum of current design alternatives 
based on our implementations of a global address language 
on the Thinking Machines CM-5, Intel Paragon, Meiko CS-2, Cray T3D, and Berkeley NOW. This evaluation includes 
a range of compilation strategies that make varying use of 
the network processor; each is optimized for the target architecture and the particular strategy. We analyze a family 
of interacting issues that determine the performance tradeoffs in each implementation, quantify the resulting latency, 
overhead, and bandwidth of the global access operations, 
and demonstrate the effects on application performance.  </abstract>

<title> An Improved Algorithm for Performance Optimal Technology 
Mapping with Retiming in LUT-Based FPGA Design  </title>
<author> Jason Cong and Chang Wu  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Science 
University of California, </affiliation> <address> Los Angeles, CA 90024  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
A novel algorithm, named SeqMapII, of technology 
mapping with retiming for optimal clock period for K-LUT based FPGAs was recently proposed by Pan and 
Liu [13]. The time complexity of their algorithm, however, is O(K 3 n 4 log(Kn 2 ) log n) for sequential circuits 
with n gates, which is too high for medium and large 
size designs in practice. In this paper, we present 
three strategies to improve the performance of the approach in [13]: 1) efficient label update with single 
K-cut computation based on the monotone property 
of labels that we showed for sequential circuits, 2) a 
novel approach for the K-cut computation on partial 
flow networks, which are much smaller in practice, 3) 
SCC (strongly connected component) partition to further speedup the algorithm. In practice, our algorithm 
works in O(K 2 n 3 log n) time and O(Kn) space according to our experimental results. It is 2fi10 4 times faster 
than SeqMapII-opt for computing optimal solutions and 
2 times faster than SeqMapII-heu which uses very small 
expanded circuits as a heuristic.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
An extended visual cryptography scheme, EVCS for short, for an access structure 
( Qual ; Forb ) on a set of n participants, is a technique to encode n images in such a 
way that when we stack together the transparencies associated to participants in any 
set X 2 Qual we get the secret message with no trace of the original images, but any 
X 2 Forb has no information on the shared image. Moreover, after the original images 
are encoded they are still meaningful, that is, any user will recognize the image on his 
transparency. 
The main contributions of this paper are the following: 
* A trade-off between the contrast of the reconstructed image and the contrast of the 
image on each transparency for (k; k)-threshold EVCS (in a (k; k)-threshold EVCS 
the image is visible if and only if k transparencies are stacked together). This yields 
a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of (k; k)-threshold EVCS for 
the values of such contrasts. In case a scheme exists we explicitly construct it. 
* A general technique to implement extended visual cryptography schemes, which 
uses hypergraph colourings. This technique yields (k; k)-threshold EVCS which 
are optimal with respect to the pixel expansion. Finally, we discuss some applications of this technique to various interesting classes of access structures by using 
relevant results from the theory of hypergraph colourings.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The FAA Aging Aircraft Research Program is 
supporting the development of a robotic mobile 
nondestructive inspection (NDI) instrument 
deployment tool at Carnegie Mellon University 
(CMU) with the active participation of USAir. The 
program has spawned several new relationships 
and entities: an alliance with an ARPA-funded 
research program at CMU having the capability to 
add 3D-stereoscopic enhanced visual inspection 
capability, a start-up company organized to 
commercialize the combined technologies, and 
State of Pennsylvania funding to foster this 
commercialization. As a result of these activities 
and connections the civilian sector appears to be 
ahead of the military sector in important aspects of 
automation for deployment of aircraft inspection 
equipment. A partnership between the university 
researchers, the airline operator, the start-up 
company, and the state government is thus 
emerging as the likely agent for transfer of the 
civilian-developed technology to the military sector.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes automatic document categorization based on large text hierarchy. We 
handle the large number of features and training examples by taking into account hierarchical 
structure of examples and using feature selection for large text data. We experimentally evaluate 
feature subset selection on real-world text data collected from the existing Web hierarchy named 
Yahoo. In our learning experiments naive Bayesian classifier was used on text data using feature-vector document representation that includes word sequences (n-grams) instead of just single words 
(unigrams). Experimental evaluation on real-world data collected form the Web shows that our 
approach gives promising results and can potentially be used for document categorization on the 
Web. Additionally the best result on our data is achieved for relatively small feature subset, while for 
larger subset the performance substantially drops. The best performance among six tested feature 
scoring measure was achieved by the feature scoring measure called Odds ratio that is known from 
information retrieval.  </abstract>

Access to shared data is provided today by distributed file systems and 
databases. In this paper, we explore certain usage and technological trends that 
will radically change the way shared data is used in the future. The usage trends 
include the growing need to access shared data from anywhere, increasing scale, 
and the increasing importance of efficient search. The technology trends include 
the advent of portable machines, the availability of software and hardware for 
using diverse types of data, and the growing diversity of network speeds and 
capabilities. These trends induce fundamental research problems in the areas of 
adaptive system behavior, secure remote execution and extensibility.  </abstract>

English and also in German into one of German, English or 
Japanese. The system has been designed around the task 
of conference registration (CR). It has initially been built 
based on a speech database of 12 read dialogs, encompassing a vocabulary of around 500 words. We have since been 
expanding the system along several dimensions to improve

<abstract> Abstract 
AURORA is a vision-based system designed to warn a vehicle driver of possible impending roadway departure accidents. It employs a downward looking color video camera with a wide angle 
lens, a digitizer, and a portable Sun Sparc workstation. Using a binormalized adjustable template 
correlation algorithm, it reliably detects lane markers on structured roads at 60 Hz. A time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) measurement is calculated for each image based on the estimation of vehicles lateral position and velocity. This measurement is used to trigger an alarm when the TLC falls below 
a preset threshold. Promising results have been achieved under a variety of weather and lighting 
conditions, on many road types.  </abstract>

<title> A Combinatorial Approach to Trajectory Planning for Binary

<affiliation> Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, </affiliation> <address> Baltimore, MD 21218  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
Binary manipulators are powered by actuators 
which have only two stable states. Therefore, they 
can reach only a discrete (but possibly large) number 
of locations. Compared to a manipulator built with 
continuous actuators, a binary manipulator provides 
reasonable performance, and is relatively inexpensive 
(up to an order of magnitude cheaper). The number 
of states of a binary manipulator grows exponentially 
with the number of actuators. This makes the calculation of its inverse kinematics quite difficult. This 
paper presents a combinatorial method for computing 
the inverse kinematics of a binary manipulator that 
reduces the search space to a manageable size. It also 
creates extremely smooth motions that follow a specified trajectory very accurately (in both position and 
orientation), despite the discrete nature of binary actuation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. This paper presents an overview of a parallelizing compiler 
to automatically generate efficient code for large-scale parallel architectures from sequential input programs. This research focuses on loop-level 
parallelism in dense matrix computations. We illustrate the basic techniques the compiler uses by describing the entire compilation process for 
a simple example. 
Our compiler is organized into three major phases: analyzing array references, allocating the computation and data to the processors to optimize 
parallelism and locality, and generating code. 
An optimizing compiler for scalable parallel machines requires more sophisticated program analysis than the traditional data dependence analysis. Our compiler uses a precise data-flow analysis technique to identify 
the producer of the value read by each instance of a read access. In order to allocate the computation and data to the processors, the compiler 
first transforms the program to expose loop-level parallelism in the computation. It then finds a decomposition of the computation and data 
such that parallelism is exploited and the communication overhead is 
minimized. The compiler will trade off extra degrees of parallelism to 
reduce or eliminate communication. Finally, the compiler generates code 
to manage the multiple address spaces and to communicate data across 
processors.  </abstract>

<title> CC 
++ : A Declarative Concurrent 
Object Oriented Programming Notation  </title>
<author> K. Mani Chandy Carl Kesselman  </author>

<date> September 18, 1992  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
CC ++ is Compositional C ++ , a parallel object-oriented notation 
that consists of C ++ with six extensions. The goals of the CC ++ 
project are to provide a theory, notation and tools for developing reliable scalable concurrent program libraries, and to provide a framework 
for unifying: 
1. distributed reactive systems, batch-oriented numeric and sym 
bolic applications, and user-interface systems, 
2. declarative programs and object-oriented imperative programs, 
and 
3. deterministic and nondeterministic programs. 
This paper is a brief description of the motivation for CC ++ , the

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we introduce a new approach for parallel, distributed simulation of modular, hierarchical 
DEVS and DEVS-based combined discrete/continuous 
multiformalism models. The algorithm combines 
conservative and optimistic distributed simulation 
strategies and is able to optimally exploit lookahead 
capabilities of the model. The object oriented implementation in C++ is intended to serve as a powerful 
simulator in the STIMS modeling and simulation environment.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The communication latency is a major issue that must be dealt with in parallel 
computing. The parallel computation model therefore must provide the ability to tolerate 
such latencies. Communication using blocking receives is the commonly used mechanism 
in parallel programming today. Message driven execution is an alternate mechanism 
which does not use receive style statements at all. The message driven execution style 
promotes the overlap of computation and communication: Programs written in this style 
exhibit increased latency tolerance. However, they are often difficult to develop and 
debug. We present a coordination language called Dagger to alleviate this problem. The 
language has a mechanism which is called expect, that replaces the receive statement. 
It has been implemented in the Charm parallel programming system, and runs programs 
portably on a variety of parallel machines.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The advent and acceptance of massively parallel 
machines has made it increasingly important to have 
tools to analyze the performance of programs running on these machines. Current day performance 
tools suffer from two drawbacks: they are not scalable 
and they lose specific information about the user program in their attempt for generality. In this paper, 
we present Projections, a scalable performance tool, 
for Charm that can provide program-specific information to help the users better understand the behavior 
of their programs.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract One of the main hurdles to improved CLIR effectiveness is resolving ambiguity associated with translation. 
Availability of resources is also a problem. First we present a 
technique based on co-occurrence statistics from unlinked corpora which can be used to reduce the ambiguity associated with 
phrasal and term translation. We then combine this method 
with other techniques for reducing ambiguity and achieve more 
than 90% monolingual effectiveness. Finally, we compare the 
co-occurrence method with parallel corpus and machine translation techniques and show that good retrieval effectiveness can 
be achieved without complex resources.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The retrieval of images based on their visual similarity 
to an example image is an important and fascinating area of 
research. Here, a method to characterize visual appearance 
for determining global similarity in images is described. 
Images are filtered with Gaussian derivatives and geometric features are computed from the filtered images. 
The geometric features used here are curvature and phase. 
Two images may be said to be similar if they have similar distributions of such features. Global similarity may, 
therefore, be deduced by comparing histograms of these 
features. This allows for rapid retrieval and examples from 
collection of gray-level and trademark images are shown.  </abstract>

<title> Kinetic Binary Space Partitions for 
Intersecting Segments and Disjoint Triangles  </title>
<note> (Extended Abstract)  </note>
<author> Pankaj K. Agarwal Jeff Erickson Leonidas J. Guibas   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We describe randomized algorithms for efficiently maintaining a binary space partition of continuously moving, possibly 
intersecting, line segments in the plane, and of continuously 
moving but disjoint triangles in space. Our two-dimensional 
BSP has depth O(log n) and size O(n log n + k) and can be 
constructed in expected O(n log 2 n + k log n) time, where k 
is the number of intersecting pairs. We can detect combinatorial changes to our BSP caused by the motion of the segments, and we can update our BSP in expected O(log n) time 
per change. Our three-dimensional BSP has depth O(log n), 
size O(n log 2 n+k 0 ), construction time O(n log 3 n+k 0 log n), 
and update time O(log 2 n) (all expected), where k 0 is the 
number of intersections between pairs of edges in the xy-projection of the triangles. Under reasonable assumptions 
about the motion of the segments or triangles, the expected 
number of number of combinatorial changes to either BSP is 
O(mn s (n)), where m is the number of moving objects and 
s (n) is the maximum length of an (n; s) Davenport-Schinzel 
sequence for some constant s.  </abstract>

Applications of a Data Structure for Finding Pairwise Interactions   </title>

<note> Submitted to Discrete & Computational Geometry  </note>
<date> July 1, 1998  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
The straight skeleton of a polygon is a variant of the medial axis, introduced by 
Aichholzer et al., defined by a shrinking process in which each edge of the polygon 
moves inward at a fixed rate. We construct the straight skeleton of an n-gon with r 
reflex vertices in time O(n 1+" + n 8=11+" r 9=11+" ), for any fixed " &gt; 0, improving the 
previous best upper bound of O(nr log n). Our algorithm simulates the sequence of 
collisions between edges and vertices during the shrinking process, using a technique of 
Eppstein for maintaining extrema of binary functions to reduce the problem of finding 
successive interactions to two dynamic range query problems: (1) maintain a changing 
set of triangles in IR 3 and answer queries asking which triangle would be first hit by 
a query ray, and (2) maintain a changing set of rays in IR 3 and answer queries asking 
for the lowest intersection of any ray with a query triangle. We also exploit a novel 
characterization of the straight skeleton as a lower envelope of triangles in IR 3 . The same 
time bounds apply to constructing non-self-intersecting offset curves with mitered or 
beveled corners, and similar methods extend to other problems of simulating collisions 
and other pairwise interactions among sets of moving objects.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Since uncalibrated images permit only projective reconstruction, metric information requires either 
camera or scene calibration. We propose a stratified approach to projective reconstruction, in which 
gradual increase in domain information for scene calibration leads to gradual increase in 3D information. 
Our scheme includes the following steps: (1) Register the images with respect to a reference plane; this 
can be done using limited scene information, e.g., the knowledge that two pairs of lines on the plane are 
parallel. We show that this calibration is sufficient for ordinal reconstruction sorting the points by their 
height over the reference plane. (2) If available, use the relative height of two additional out-of-plane 
points to compute the height of the remaining points up to constant scaling. Our scheme is based on the 
dual epipolar geometry in the reference frame, which we develop below. We show good results with five 
sequences of real images, using mostly scene calibration that can be inferred directly from the images 
themselves.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems 
differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy 
used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently 
construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, 
we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively 
constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, 
which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we 
evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control 
strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering 
in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization 
strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by 
analysts often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these 
criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error 
rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this 
performance task we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning 
systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and 
simplicity dimensions.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We consider the problem of indexing general database 
workloads (combinations of data sets and sets of potential queries). We define a framework for measuring the 
efficiency of an indexing scheme for a workload based on 
two characterizations: storage redundancy (how many 
times each item in the data set is stored), and access 
overhead (how many times more blocks than necessary 
does a query retrieve). Using this framework we present 
some initial results, showing upper and lower bounds 
and trade-offs between them in the case of multi-dimensional range queries and set queries.  </abstract>

<abstract> The World-Wide Web is changing the nature of software development to a distributive 
plug & play process. This requires a new way of managing software by so-called intelligent 
software brokers. The aim of the European IBROW3 project is to develop an intelligent 
brokering service that enables third party knowledge-component reuse through the 
World-Wide Web. Suppliers provide libraries of knowledge components adhering to some 
standard, and customers can consult these libraries -- through intelligent brokers -- to 
configure a knowledge system suited to their needs by selection and adaptation. IBROW3 
integrates research on heterogeneous databases, interoperability and web technology with 
knowledge-system technology and ontologies. The aim is to develop a broker that can handle 
web requests for classes of knowledge system (e.g. diagnostic systems) by accessing 
libraries of reusable problem-solving methods on the Web, and selecting, adapting and 
configuring these methods in accordance with the domain at hand.  
The aim of this paper is to give a general overview of the project and to presents its main 
ideas and approach. IBROW3 has started on January 1, 1998 and thus we can only present 
preliminary results.   </abstract>

A diagonal of a planar, simple polygon P is an open line segment that connects

time algorithm for finding a shortest diagonal (in the L 2 norm) of a simple polygon, 
improving the previous best result by a factor of log n. Our result provides an interesting 
contrast to a known (n log n) lower bound for finding a closest pair of vertices in a 
simple polygon|observe that a shortest diagonal is defined by a closest pair of vertices 
satisfying an additional visibility constraint.  </abstract>

<author> Michael Luby Dana Randall Alistair Sinclair   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
Consider the following Markov chain, whose states 
are all domino tilings of a 2n fi 2n chessboard: starting from some arbitrary tiling, pick a 2 fi 2 window 
uniformly at random. If the four squares appearing in 
this window are covered by two parallel dominoes, rotate the dominoes in place. Repeat many times. This 
process is used in practice to generate a random tiling, 
and is a key tool in the study of the combinatorics of 
tilings and the behavior of dimer systems in statistical physics. Analogous Markov chains are used to 
randomly generate other structures on various two-dimensional lattices. This paper presents techniques 
which prove for the first time that, in many interesting cases, a small number of random moves suffice to 
obtain a uniform distribution.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes an experimental study of constraint-based network design. We used a 
novel network design tool, implemented in Java, to design representative networks joining 
major U.S. cities. The cost of three topologies: Best Star, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), 
and Delaunay Triangulation, are compared, with and without localized traffic constraints. 
The best star network gives near optimal result when the traffic is only constrained by source 
and sink capacity of switches (flat traffic constraints). With localized traffic constraints, the 
most cost effective network has a structure similar to the MST. The cheapest network has a 
tree structure when there are only flat traffic constraints, but can have cycles when localized 
traffic constraints are present.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We empirically analyze and compare two simple, deterministic policies for scheduling dynamically evolving tree-structured computations on parallel architectures that are rings of identical 
processing elements (PEs). Our computations have each task either halt or spawn two independent children; they abstract, for instance, computations generated by multigrid methods. Our 
simpler policy, called koso, has each PE keep one child of a spawning task and pass the other 
to its clockwise neighbor in the ring; our more sophisticated policy, called koso ? , operates similarly, but allows child-passing only from a more heavily loaded PE to a more lightly loaded one. 
Both policies execute waiting tasks in increasing order of their depths in the evolving task-tree. 
Based on partial (mathematical) analyses of our policies' behaviors, we conjectured that both 
yield good parallel speedup on large classes of the computations we study, but that policy 
koso ? outperforms policy koso in many important situations. Not having been able to verify 
these conjectures analytically, we study them in this paper via a suite of carefully designed and 
analyzed experiments. Our experiments largely substantiate both of our conjectures. We find 
that both policies give close to optimal parallel speedup on large classes of computations, and 
that koso ? outperforms koso on these computations, except on very small processor rings. 
We believe that our methodology of experimental design and analysis will prove useful in other 
such studies.  </abstract>

<title> Using Real-Valued Genetic Algorithms to Evolve Rule Sets for

<author> Arthur L. Corcoran Sandip Sen  </author>
<abstract> Abstract| In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of classification rules with 
real-valued attributes. We show how real-valued 
attribute ranges can be encoded with real-valued 
genes and present a new uniform method for representing don't cares in the rules. We view supervised classification as an optimization problem, 
and evolve rule sets that maximize the number of 
correct classifications of input instances. We use a 
variant of the Pitt approach to genetic-based machine learning system with a novel conflict resolution mechanism between competing rules within 
the same rule set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach 
on a benchmark wine classifier system.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Today's high-performance RISC microprocessors have been 
highly tuned for integer and floating point application performance. These architectures have paid less attention to 
operating system requirements. At the same time, new operating system designs often have overlooked modern architectural trends which may unavoidably change the relative 
cost of certain primitive operations. The result is that operating system performance is well below application code 
performance on contemporary RISCs. 
This paper examines recent directions in computer architecture and operating systems, and the implications of 
changes in each domain for the other. The requirements of 
three components of operating system design are discussed 
in detail: interprocess communication, virtual memory, and 
thread management. For each component, we relate operating system functional and performance needs to the mechanisms available on commercial RISC architectures such as 
the MIPS R2000 and R3000, Sun SPARC, IBM RS6000, 
Motorola 88000, and Intel i860. 
Our analysis reveals a number of specific reasons why 
the performance of operating system primitives on RISCs 
has not scaled with integer performance. In addition, 
we identify areas in which architectures could better (and 
cost-effectively) accommodate operating system needs, and 
areas in which operating system design could accommodate certain necessary characteristics of cost-effective high-performance microprocessors.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Many important and useful applications for software agents 
require multiple agents on a network that communicate with 
each other. Such agents must find each other and perform a 
useful joint computation without having to know about every 
other such agent on the network. This paper describes a 
matchmaker 
system, designed to find people with similar interests and introduce them to each other. The matchmaker is 
designed to introduce  
everyone 
, unlike conventional Internet 
media which only allow those who take the time to  
speak 
public to be known. 
The paper details how the agents that make it up the match-making system can function in a decentralized fashion, yet 
can group themselves into clusters which reflect their users 
interests; these clusters are then used to make introductions or 
allow users to send messages to others who share their inter 
ests. The algorithm uses  
referrals 
from one agent to another 
in the same fashion that word-of-mouth is used when people 
are looking for an expert. A prototype of the system has been 
implemented, and results of its use are presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe the design and implementation of a compiler 
that automatically translates ordinary programs written in 
a subset of ML into code that generates native code at run 
time. Run-time code generation can make use of values and 
invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time, yielding 
code that is often superior to statically optimal code. But 
the cost of optimizing and generating code at run time can 
be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce the cost of run-time code generation by 
an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code quality. 
Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an 
average cost of only six cycles per instruction generated at 
run time.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper provides a tutorial introduction to visual servo control of robotic manipulators. 
Since the topic spans many disciplines our goal is limited to providing a basic conceptual framework. We begin by reviewing the prerequisite topics from robotics and computer vision, including 
a brief review of coordinate transformations, velocity representation, and a description of the 
geometric aspects of the image formation process. We then present a taxonomy of visual servo 
control systems. The two major classes of systems, position-based and image-based systems, are 
then discussed. Since any visual servo system must be capable of tracking image features in a 
sequence of images, we include an overview of feature-based and correlation-based methods for 
tracking. We conclude the tutorial with a number of observations on the current directions of 
the research field of visual servo control.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We have implemented a parallel version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for the single-source shortest paths 
problem. Our software has been developed on the CM-5 using C with CMMD communication primitives. 
We have empirically compared the efficiency of our implementation with a sequential implementation of 
the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm developed by Cherkassky, Goldberg and Radzik. We have performed 
our experiments using fifty randomly generated graphs with vertex counts in the range between 2 10 and 
2 15 and edge counts in the range between 2 11 and 2 21 . In our experiments, the parallel implementation 
becomes faster than the sequential implementation when the average degree of the input graphs exceeds 
2 5 or 2 6 . For the dense graphs in our test suite, we obtain speedups of up to 3.3 on 32 processors and up 
to 8.3 on 128 processors. 
In the implementation we discuss in this paper, several design decisions were taken in view of the limited 
time we had to complete a working version of our software. For example, instead of performing any kind 
of dynamic load balancing, we try to keep the computation load balanced by applying a straightforward 
data distribution scheme at the beginning of the computation. Moreover, in the code that runs on 
each processor, we avoid any sophisticated data structures and only use linear arrays. We are currently 
experimenting with alternative implementations that may lead to improved speedups, particularly on the 
denser graphs of our test suite.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The paper presents the general theory of designing multidimensional Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF), 
for use in sub-band coding (SBC) systems, using the McClellan transform [1]. It was recently shown that 
McClellan transform could be used to generate 2-D diamond shape QMF filters [2]. In this paper we will 
formalize the proofs of the diamond shape case, and generalize it to other shapes, sampling rasters and 
dimensions. 
Moreover we show that we do not really need the 1-D QMF filters: it is also possible and even more 
convenient to design QMF filter banks by performing transformations on a class of real valued polynomials. 
Examples are given of two dimensional diamond and fan-shape filters and three dimensional tetrad filters 
designed using this transformation technique.  </abstract>

We are developing design principles applying tangible interfaces to storytelling. This paper describes an underlying 
philosophy and three resultant designs for computer-mediated toys, exploring how the merging of physical objects 
with computer technology can enhance childrens storytelling. Each prototype aims to develop a specific set of both 
oral and written storytelling skills, as well as collaboration, sharing, and the notion of revision. By creating 
narratives, children learn about culture and identity, and develop a sense of self. In addition, narrative can be used as 
a gateway to draw girls into technology. The use of multi-sensory interfaces allows for richer interaction.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Despite the emergence of high speed LANs, the communication performance available to applications on workstation clusters still falls short of that available on MPPs. 
A new generation of efficient messaging layers is needed to take advantage of the hardware performance and to deliver it to the application level. Communication software 
is the key element in bridging the communication performance gap separating MPPs 
and workstation clusters. 
MPI-FM is a high performance implementation of MPI for networks of workstations connected with a Myrinet network, built on top of the Fast Messages (FM) library. 
Based on the FM version 1.1 released in Fall 1995, MPI-FM achieves a minimum one-way latency of 19 s and a peak bandwidth of 17.3 MByte/s with common MPI send 
and receive function calls. A direct comparison using published performance figures 
shows that MPI-FM running on SPARCstation 20 workstations connected with a relatively inexpensive Myrinet network outperforms the MPI implementations available 
on the IBM SP2 and the Cray T3D, both in latency and in bandwidth, for messages 
up to 2 KByte in size.  </abstract>

Multiple lightweight processes or threads have multiple stacks, and a thread context switch moves 
execution from one stack to another. On the SPARC 1 architecture, parts of a thread's stack can be 
cached in register windows while the thread is running. The cached data must be flushed to memory 
when the thread is suspended. Doing the flushing both efficiently and correctly can be tricky. This 
document discusses the implementation of a non-preemptive user-space threads package under SunOS 2 .  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A recognition strategy consisting of a mixture of indexing on invariants and search, allows objects to be recog-nised up to a Euclidean ambiguity with an uncalibrated 
camera. The approach works by using projective invariants to determine all the possible projectively equivalent 
models for a particular imaged object; then a system of 
global consistency constraints is used to determine which of 
these projectively equivalent, but Euclidean distinct, models corresponds to the objects viewed. These constraints 
follow from properties of the imaging geometry. In particular, a recognition hypothesis is equivalent to an assertion about, among other things, viewing conditions and geometric relationships between objects, and these assertions 
must be consistent for hypotheses to be correct. The approach is demonstrated to work on images of real scenes 
consisting of polygonal objects and polyhedra. </abstract> <keyword> Keywords:

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes several key trends in technology that will inuence the design of file systems for the next decade. It first outlines the basic trends to hardware performance that underlie 
file system design. These trends affect both user demands on file systems and trade-offs in their 
design. It then considers how technologies will drive more demanding file system workloads that 
will require scalable file systems. Next, it outlines how opportunities raised by these low-level 
technology trends impact specific aspects of the xFS file systems serverless design [Dahlin 
et al., 1994b, Anderson et al., 1996]. Finally, to put xFSs serverless approach in context, it discusses other technology trends that affect file systems but that are not explicitly addressed in the 
serverless design.  </abstract>

<title> Importing Pre-packaged Software into Lisp: Experience with 
Arbitrary-Precision Floating-Point Numbers  </title>
<author> Richard J. Fateman  </author>
<affiliation> University of California at Berkeley  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
We advocate the use of Common Lisp as a powerful glue for 
building scientific computing environments. Naturally one 
then has to address mixing pre-existing (non Lisp) code into 
this system. We provide a specific example as an elaborate 
FORTRAN system written by David Bailey for arbitrary-precision floating-point numeric calculation. We discuss the 
advantages and disadvantages of wholesale importing into 
Lisp. A major advantage is being able to use state-of-the 
art packaged software sooner, while overcoming the disadvantages caused by FORTRAN's traditional batch orientation and weak storage model. In this paper we emphasize in 
particular how effective use of imported systems may require 
one to address the contrast between the functional (Lisp-like) versus state-transition-based (Fortran-like) approaches 
to dealing with compound objects. While our example is 
high-precision floats, other highly useful packages including those for simulation, PDE solutions, signal processing, 
statistical computation, etc. may also benefit by similar 
consideration.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, we study the tradeoffs involved in choosing the bit allocation in a 
multiresolution remote image retrieval system. Such a system uses a multiresolution 
image coding scheme so that a user accessing the database will first see a coarse 
version of the images and will be able to accept or discard a given image faster, 
without needing to receive all the image data. We formalize the problem of choosing 
the bit allocation (e.g., in the two resolution case, how many bits should be given 
to the coarse image and the additional information, respectively?) so that the 
overall delay in the query is minimized. We provide analytical methods to find the 
optimal solution under different configurations and show how a good choice of the 
bit allocation results in a significant reduction of the overall delay in the query (by 
up to a factor of two in some cases).  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well 
in traditional networks made up of wired links with stationary hosts. Networks with wireless links and mobile 
hosts violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded performance. In this paper, we describe a 
simple protocol that improves TCP performance by modifying network-layer software only at a basestation without 
violating end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea is to 
cache packets at the basestation and perform local 
retransmissions. Simulations of this protocol show that it 
is significantly more robust in the presence of multiple 
packet losses in a single transmission window as compared to TCP. This enables our protocol to tolerate at least 
10 times as high an error rate without any performance 
degradation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Several researchers have proposed algorithms for basic block reordering. We call these branch alignment algorithms. The primary 
emphasis of these algorithms has been on improving instruction 
cache locality, and the few studies concerned with branch prediction reported small or minimal improvements. As wide-issue architectures become increasingly popular the importance of reducing 
branch costs will increase, and branch alignment is one mechanism 
which can effectively reduce these costs. 
In this paper, we propose an improved branch alignment algorithm that takes into consideration the architectural cost model and 
the branch prediction architecture when performing the basic block 
reordering. We show that branch alignment algorithms can improve 
a broad range of static and dynamic branch prediction architectures. 
We also show that a programs performance can be improved by approximately 5% even when using recently proposed, highly accurate 
branch prediction architectures. The programs are compiled by any 
existing compiler and then transformed via binary transformations. 
When implementing these algorithms on a Alpha AXP 21604 up to 
a 16% reduction in total execution time is achieved.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: This paper presents empirical data on the behavior of large dataflow programs on 
a distributed memory multiprocessor. The programs, written in the dataflow language Id90, are 
compiled via a Threaded Abstract Machine (TAM) for the CM-5. TAM refines dataflow execution 
models by addressing critical constraints that modern parallel architectures place on the compilation 
of general-purpose parallel programming languages. It exposes synchronization, scheduling, and 
network access so that the compiler can optimize against the cost of these operations. 
The data presented in this paper evaluates the TAM approach in compiling dataflow languages 
on stock hardware. We present data on the instruction mix, speedup, scheduling behavior, and 
locality of large ID90 programs. It is shown that the TAM scheduling hierarchy is able to tolerate 
long communication latencies, especially when some degree of I-structure locality is present. We investigate how frame allocation strategies, k-bounded loops, and I-structure caching and distribution 
together affect the overall efficiency. Finally we document some scheduling anomalies.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
As the difference in speed between processor and memory system continues to increase, it is becoming crucial to develop 
and refine techniques that enhance the effectiveness of cache 
hierarchies. Two such techniques are data prefetching and 
data forwarding. With prefetching, a processor hides the latency of cache misses by requesting the data before it actually 
needs it. With forwarding, a producer processor hides the 
latency of communication-induced cache misses in the consumer processors by sending the data to the caches of the 
latter. These two techniques are complementary approaches 
to hiding the latency of communication-induced misses. 
This paper compares the effectiveness of data forwarding 
and data prefetching to hide communication-induced misses. 
Although both techniques require comparable hardware support, forwarding usually has a lower instruction overhead. We 
evaluate prefetching and forwarding algorithms in a paralleliz-ing compiler using execution-driven simulations of a shared-memory multiprocessor. Both data forwarding and prefetch-ing reduce the execution time of applications significantly (30-40% on average). Forwarding performs better on average, 
while prefetching is more robust to changes in cache and memory parameters. Finally, we propose two ways of integrating 
the two techniques. The integration of the two techniques reduces the execution time even more (43-48% on average) and 
is very robust.  </abstract>

<title> Optimizing Primary Data Caches for Parallel 
Scientific Applications: The Pool Buffer Approach 1  </title>

<abstract> Abstract 
Optimizing on-chip primary data caches for parallel scientific applications is challenging because different applications 
exhibit different behavior. Indeed, while some applications 
exhibit good spatial locality, others have accesses with long 
strides that prevent the effective use of cache lines. Finally, 
other applications cannot exploit long lines because they exhibit false sharing. To help processors execute these three 
types of applications efficiently, we introduce the Pool Buffer, 
a small direct-mapped cache accessed in parallel with the primary cache. The function of the pool buffer is to fetch long 
sectors of relatively short cache lines from memory on a miss, 
while only letting into the cache the lines that the processor 
actually references. The pool buffer can also perform sequential prefetching of sectors. 
An evaluation of the pool buffer based on simulations of 
five 32-processor Perfect Club codes yields encouraging results. Adding a pool buffer of one-quarter the size of the 
cache causes a small increase in area while usually achieving 
large reductions in execution time. For example, for a range 
of caches with 32-byte lines, the execution time decreases by 
an average of about 20%. We also show that small 1-Kbyte 
buffers are often large enough to get most of the potential 
benefits. Finally, caches with pool buffers are more effective 
than caches with long lines and no pool buffer.  </abstract>

the potential for unprecedented performance, such 
as smart buildings, reconfigurable factories, adaptive 
traffic systems and remote earth ecosystem monitoring. To achieve high performance these massive systems will need to accurately model themselves and 
their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the 
art of large-scale modeling. This paper presents a 
formalization of decompositional, model-based learning 
(DML), a method developed by observing a modeler's 
expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation 
tasks. The method exploits a striking analogy between 
learning and consistency-based diagnosis. Moriarty, 
an implementation of DML, has been applied to thermal modeling of a smart building, demonstrating a 
significant improvement in learning rate.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In image segmentation problems, there is usually a vast amount of filter 
operations available, a subset of which has to be selected and instantiated 
in order to obtain a satisfactory segmentation procedure for a particular domain. In supervised segmentation, a mapping from features, such as filter 
outputs for individual pixels, to classes is induced automatically. However, 
since the sample size required for supervised learning grows exponentially 
in the number of features it is not feasible to learn a segmentation procedure 
from a large amount of possible filters. But we argue that automatic model 
selection methods are able to select a region model in terms of some filters. 
We propose a wrapper algorithm that performs this task. We present results 
on artificial textured images (Brodatz) and report on our experiences with 
x-ray images.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. In this work it will be shown, how the comparison of recursive program schemata (RPS) can be reduced to an only slightly modified 
type of the search for maximal isomorphic subgraphs by interpreting the 
RPS as directed, cyclic, labelled graphs. The quality of the mapping of 
two RPS can be used as a quantitative measure for similarity of RPS 
among each other. The simultaneously calculated graph morphism can 
serve as a basis for the detection of analogies between the RPS. A special 
neural net, developed for the solution of general graph-matching problems, realizes the search for a sensible and as comprising as possible 
mapping between two RPS. It is shown, which special properties of RPS 
have to be accounted for in the modeling and how these can be incorporated into the algorithms when using a special neural approach for the 
solution.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Kinetic simulation of plasmas in which equilibrium occurs over ion timescales poses 
a computational challenge due to the disparate timescales of the electron plasma frequency (~ 10 9 ), the ion plasma frequency (~ 10 7 ), ion transit frequency (~ 10 6 ), and 
the ionization frequency (~ 10 7 ). Hybrid electrostatic PIC algorithms are presented 
in which the electrons reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the ions each time step. 
There are two different approximations for the electrons. First, the nonlinear Boltzmann relationship for the electrons can be applied to the bulk of a plasma. Second, 
there is a truncated Maxwellian which is used in sheaths; this approximation truncates 
the electron distribution at the wall potential. The error associated with neglecting 
this second approximation in the sheath is small. The collision cross section, (E), can 
be a tabulated or fitted function; the method is implemented with He cross sections. 
These approximations neglect effects faster than ion time-scales, decreasing the computer time used by over an order of magnitude; however, they increase the complexity 
of the boundary conditions and the simulation is no longer self-consistent. Theoretical 
ramifications of these approximations are examined, and results are compared with full  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Experiments have shown[1],[2] that ion acoustic solitons tunnel through the space charge sheath 
in front of a grid without time delay. They are absorbed resonantly when the spatial width of the 
wave is close to the characteristic gradient scale length of the sheath. The reflection and transmission 
coefficients found in these experiments have compared well with theory in the long wavelength limit[3]. 
However, to achieve this comparison, two parameters were added that were not in the original theory. 
These parameters allow for the absorption of wave energy by the space charge sheath. The goal of our 
numerical simulations, designed to reproduce the experimental results, is to uncover the mechanism of 
this energy loss and large speed of propagation through the sheath.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This survey paper describes the current approaches on the update-in-place analysis 
for sets. Pure functional languages do not allow mutations, destructive updates, or selective updates so that straightforward implementations of functional language compilers 
may induce large amounts of copying to preserve program semantics. The unnecessary 
copying of data can increase both the execution time and the memory requirements of 
an application. Introducing sets to functional languages as a primitive data constructor posts a new problem of update-in-place analysis in functional languages. Moreover, most of the compiler optimization techniques depend on the side-effects and the 
update-in-place analysis serves as the premise of applying such optimization techniques. 
Among other compiler optimization techniques, finite differencing captures common yet 
distinctive program constructions of costly repeated calculations and transforms them 
into more efficient incremental program constructions. This dissertation is an attempt 
to explore the update-in-place analysis for sets in functional languages in order to apply finite differencing to compiling pure functional languages. In this survey paper, 
we will describe the approaches of update-in-place analysis and the finite differencing 
techniques.  </abstract>

Production Using the OPAL Detector

The OPAL Collaboration  </title>
<abstract> Abstract 
A search for charginos and neutralinos, predicted by supersymmetric theories, has been 
performed using a data sample of 2.6 pb 1 at a centre-of-mass energy of p s =130 GeV and 
2.6 pb 1 at 136 GeV collected with the OPAL detector at LEP during November 1995. No 
candidate events were observed. The 95% C.L. lower limit on the lightest chargino mass 
in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is 65.4 GeV if the universal scalar mass 
m 0 is greater than 1 TeV, and 58.7 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with slepton and 
sneutrino mass limits obtained at centre-of-mass energies near the Z peak. These limits 
were obtained under the conditions that the lightest chargino is heavier than the lightest 
neutralino by more than 10 GeV and tan fi is larger than 1.5. The results of a model 
independent search for charginos and neutralinos are also given.  </abstract>

We use the two time influence functional method of the path integral approach in 
order to reduce the dimension of the coupled-channels equations for heavy-ion reactions

it easily enables us to study the cases where the initial spin of the colliding particle is not 
zero. It can also be easily applied to the cases where there is a spin-orbit force, and where 
the internal degrees of freedom are not necessarily collective coordinates. It also clarifies 
the underlying assumption of the approximation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We argue that the specification of an object's functional behavior and the timing constraints imposed 
on it may be separated. Specifically, we describe 
RTsynchronizer, a high-level programming language 
construct for specifying real-time constraints between 
objects in a distributed concurrent system. During program execution, RTsynchronizers affect the 
scheduling of distributed objects to enforce real-time 
relations between events. Objects in our system are 
defined in terms of the actor model extended with 
timing assumptions. Separation of the functional 
behaviors of actors and the timing constraints on 
patterns of actor invocation provides at least three 
important advantages. First, it simplifies code development by separating design concerns. Second, 
multiple timing constraints can be independently 
specified and composed. And finally, a specification 
of timing constraints can be reused even if the 
representation of the functional behavior of actors has 
changed, and conversely. 
A number of examples are given to illustrate the 
use of RTsynchronizers. These examples illustrate 
how real-time constraints for periodic events, simultaneous events, exception handling, and producer-consumer may be specified.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Concurrent systems maintain a distributed state and thus require coordination and synchronization between 
components to ensure consistency. To provide a coherent design approach to concurrent systems, recent work 
has employed an object-based methodology which emphasizes interactions through well-defined interfaces. The 
Actor model has provided formal reasoning about distributed object systems. Nonetheless, due to the complex 
interactions among components and the high volume of observable information produced, understanding and 
reasoning about concurrent algorithms in terms of simple interactions is a difficult task. Coordination patterns, 
which abstract over simple interactions, are not biased by low-level event orderings and are the appropriate 
mechanism for reasoning about concurrent algorithms. We outline a methodology for visualizing coordination 
patterns in concurrent algorithms which emphasizes observable interactions and causal connections between 
objects. We introduce visualizers as a linguistic mechanism for mapping coordination patterns to visualization. 
Visualizers are specified separately from algorithm code and thus respect code integrity. Moreover, visualizers 
may be implemented strictly in terms of object interfaces and thus preserve object encapsulation.  </abstract>

<title> Billing Users and Pricing for TCP  </title>
<author> Richard J. Edell, Nick McKeown and Pravin P. Varaiya  </author>
<abstract> Abstract| This paper presents a system for billing users 
for their TCP traffic. This is achieved by postponing the 
establishment of connections while the user is contacted, 
verifying in a secure way that they are prepared to pay. By 
presenting the user with cost and price information, the system can be used for cost recovery and to encourage efficient 
use of network resources. The system requires no changes to 
existing protocols or applications and can be used to recover 
costs between cooperating sites. Statistics collected from a 
four day trace of traffic between the University of Califor-nia, Berkeley and the rest of the Internet demonstrate that 
such a billing system is practical and introduces acceptable 
latency. An implementation based on the BayBridge prototype router is described. Our study also indicates that 
pricing schemes may be used to control network congestion 
either by rescheduling time-insensitive traffic to a less expensive time of the day, or by smoothing packet transfers to 
reduce traffic peaks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Using linguistic variables to describe the behavior of a 
hybrid system, which consists of a discrete event system and a continuous system, could make the design 
of the controller and verification of the system perform 
on an unified framework. In this paper, we show the 
construction of a fuzzy linguistic model from a given 
mathematical model of a physical system. By considering the state-space realization of the model, the system 
construction problem can be transformed into a function approximation problem. We propose to use projection theorem in obtaining an optimal fuzzy system 
which is the best approximation of a given nonlinear 
function in L 2 (U ) space. We show that the existence 
and uniqueness of the optimal solution is assured when 
the Fuzzy Basis Functions(FBFs) are linearly independent. We demonstrate that the dependence of the basis 
functions can be examined by checking the condition of 
the Gram determinant associated to the FBFs. Finally, 
a method is proposed in converting the optimal coefficients into fuzzy sets to obtain a fuzzy linguistic model.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
In a new collaborative project involving the University of California, Berkeley, NASA Ames Research 
Center, and Honeywell Systems Research Center, we 
have begun the study of hierarchical, hybrid control 
systems in the framework of air traffic management 
systems (ATMS). The need for a new ATMS arises 
from the overcrowding of large urban airports and 
the need to more efficiently land and take off larger 
numbers of aircraft, without building new runways. 
Technological advances that make a more advanced 
air traffic control system a reality include the availability of relatively inexpensive and fast real time 
computers (both on board the aircraft and in the control tower) and global positioning systems. The usefulness of these technological advances is currently 
limited by today's air traffic control system, which 
involves the use of "freeways" in the Terminal Radar 
Approach Control (TRACON) region around urban 
airports. These freeways are set approach patterns 
to runways which do not allow for the possibility of 
so-called "free flight" by an aircraft to its destination. 
Limiting the aircraft trajectories in this manner results in the addition of both planned and unplanned 
delays to air travel.  </abstract>

We propose a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design extends 
a previous control architecture that works under normal conditions of operation. The 
faults that are considered in our design are classified according to the capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. Information about these 
capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers of the architecture to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the extended control strategies that are needed 
by these supervisors and, in certain cases, give examples of their detailed operation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to explore intrinsic geometric methods of recovering the three 
dimensional motion of a moving camera from a sequence of images. Generic similarities between 
the discrete approach and the differential approach are revealed through a parallel development 
of their analogous motion estimation theories. 
We begin with a brief review of the (discrete) essential matrix approach, showing how to 
recover the 3D displacement from image correspondences. The space of normalized essential 
matrices is characterized geometrically: the unit tangent bundle of the rotation group is a 
double covering of the space of normalized essential matrices. This characterization naturally 
explains the geometry of the possible number of 3D displacements which can be obtained from 
the essential matrix. 
Second, a differential version of the essential matrix constraint previously explored by [19, 20] 
is introduced. We then present the precise characterization of the space of differential essential 
matrices, which gives rise to a novel eigenvector-decomposition-based 3D velocity estimation 
algorithm from the optical flow measurements. This algorithm gives a unique solution to the 
motion estimation problem and serves as a differential counterpart of the SVD-based 3D displacement estimation algorithm from the discrete case. 
Finally, simulation results are presented evaluating the performance of our algorithm in terms 
of bias and sensitivity of the estimates with respect to the noise in optical flow measurements. 
The presented unifying theory of the motion estimation using discrete and differential version of the Longuet-Higgins (essential) constraint can be extended to the case of uncalibrated 
cameras.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) of the future will feature Free Flight, in which aircraft choose 
their own routes, altitude, and speed, and automated conflict resolution methods in which aircraft 
will coordinate to resolve conflicts. The resulting distributed control architecture is a hybrid system, with 
mixed discrete event and continuous time dynamics. 
SmartATMS is an object oriented modeling and simulation facility which accounts for these hybrid issues 
and will serve as a uniform modeling framework for 
the design and evaluation of various ATMS concepts.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
MineSet TM , Silicon Graphics' interactive system for 
data mining, integrates three powerful technologies: 
database access, analytical data mining, and data visualization. It supports the knowledge discovery process from data access and preparation through iterative analysis and visualization to deployment. Mine-Set is based on a client-server architecture that scales 
to large databases. The database access component 
provides a rich set of operators that can be used to 
preprocess and transform the stored data into forms 
appropriate for visualization and analytical mining. 
The 3D visualization capabilities allow direct data visualization for exploratory analysis, including tools 
for displaying high-dimensional data containing geographical and hierarchical information. The analytical mining algorithms help identify potentially interesting models of the data, which can be viewed using 
visualization tools specialized for the learned models. 
Third party vendors can interface to the MineSet tools 
for model deployment and for integration with other 
packages.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present a user interface paradigm for 
database management systems that is motivated 
by scientific visualization applications. Our 
graphical user interface includes a "boxes and arrows" notation for database access and a flight 
simulator model of movement through information space. We also provide means to specify a 
hierarchy of abstracts of data of different types 
and resolutions, so that a "zoom" capability can 
be supported. The underlying DBMS support for 
this system is described and includes the compilation of query plans into megaplans, new algorithms for data buffering, and provisions for 
a guaranteed rate of data delivery. The current state of the Tioga implementation is also described.  </abstract>

In this paper we present a prototype system for 
the management of earth science data which is 
novel in that it takes a DBMS centric view of the 
the task. Our prototype -- called "BigSur" -- is 
shown in the context of its use by two geographically distributed scientific groups with demanding data storage and processing requirements. 
BigSur currently stores 1 Terabyte of data, about 
one thousandth of the volume EOSDIS must 
store. We claim that the design principles 
embodied in BigSur provide sufficient exibility 
to achieve the difficult scientific and technical

<abstract> Abstract 
The increasing size and complexity of many software 
systems demand a greater emphasis on capturing and 
maintaining knowledge at many different levels within 
the software development process. This knowledge includes descriptions of the hardware and software components and their behavior, external and internal design specifications, and support for system testing. 
The knowledge-based software engineering (KBSE) research paradigm is concerned with systems that use 
formally represented knowledge, with associated inference procedures, to support the various subactivi-ties of software development. As they grow in scale, 
KBSE systems must balance expressivity and inferential power with the real demands of knowledge base 
construction, maintenance, performance and comprehensibility. Description Logics (DL's) possess several 
features a terminological orientation, a formal semantics and efficient reasoning procedures which offer an effective tradeoff of these factors. We discuss 
three KBSE systems in which DL's capture some of 
the requisite knowledge needed to support design, coding and testing activities. We close with a discussion 
of the benefits of DL's and ways to address some of 
their limitations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
People can differentiate spoken languages 
without understanding them, and, in some 
sense, this differentiation can only be done 
without understanding the language. When 
we consider a multi-lingual person trying to 
understand an utterance spoken in one of the 
languages with which they are familiar, they 
will first decide which language this utterance 
belongs to, before trying to interpret it. 
The language identification task is one 
example of high-level feature abstraction from 
raw speech. Speech samples are classified 
into categories according to what language 
was spoken. We conjecture that this classification can be performed reliably and in real 
time. To be successful, such a system should 
be speaker-independent as well as context-independent. A large amount of training is 
required to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. 
We present a continuation of previous 
work (Kwasny et al., 1992) which introduces 
two important improvements to the system: 
(1) replacement of the non-recurrent, feed-forward network with a recurrent one, which 
is smaller, but still classifies correctly; (2) 
development of a frontend processor on a 
Nextfi workstation to facilitate sample 
recording and data acquisition. This is important for large-scale data acquisition, training, 
and testing of the network.  </abstract>

<keyword> Keywords: Bayesian image restoration; Markov random fields; max flow-min cut  </keyword>
<abstract> Abstract 
We consider the problem of maximum a posteriori (MAP) restoration of multicolor images 
where each pixel has been degraded by independent arbitrary noise. We assume that the 
prior distribution is given by a Markov random field with only pairwise site interactions. 
Two classes of site interactions are considered: two-valued site interactions, which form a 
generalized Potts model; and linear site interactions. We give efficient algorithms based on 
graph cuts for both classes. The MAP estimate for a generalized Potts model can be computed by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. While this graph problem is 
computationally intractable, there are fast algorithms for computing provably good approximations. The MAP estimate with linear site interactions can be computed exactly by solving 
a minimum cut problem on a graph. This can be performed in nearly linear time.  </abstract>

are very different with regards to the forces influencing distributed systems design.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Query caching can play a vital role in heterogeneous, multi-database environments. Answers to a query that are available in cache 
at the local client can be returned to the user 
quickly, while the rest of the query is evaluated. The use of caches can optimize query 
evaluation. By caching certain sensitive data 
locally, caches can be used to answer the parts 
of queries that involve the sensitive data, so it 
need not be shipped across the network. Most 
prior cache schemes have been tuple-based or 
page-based. It is unclear, however, how these 
might be adapted for multi-databases. We explore a more flexible semantic query caching 
(SQC) approach. In SQC, caches are the answer sets of previous queries, labeled by the 
query expressions that produced them. We 
promote developing the technology, based on 
logic, to manipulate semantic caches, to determine when and how caches can be used to answer subsequent queries, and to optimize via 
cache use.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. This paper develops a new I/O automaton model called the 
Clock General Timed Automaton (Clock GTA) model. The Clock GTA 
is based on the General Timed Automaton (GTA) of Lynch and Vaan- 
drager. The Clock GTA provides a systematic way of describing timing- 
based systems in which there is a notion of "normal" timing behavior, 
but that do not necessarily always exhibit this "normal" behavior. It can 
be used for practical time performance analysis based on the stabilization 
of the physical system. 
We use the Clock GTA automaton to model, verify and analyze the 
paxos algorithm. The paxos algorithm is an efficient and highly fault- 
tolerant algorithm, devised by Lamport, for reaching consensus in a distributed system. Although it appears to be practical, it is not widely 
known or understood. This paper contains a new presentation of the 
paxos algorithm, based on a formal decomposition into several interacting components. It also contains a correctness proof and a time performance and fault-tolerance analysis.  </abstract>

<title> Finding Maximum Flows in Undirected Graphs Seems Easier than 
Bipartite Matching +L </title>+
<author> David R. Karger and Matthew S. Levine   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
Consider an n-vertex, m-edge, undirected graph with maximum flow value v. We give a method to find augmenting 
paths in such a graph in amortized sub-linear (O(n 
p 
v)) time 
per path. This lets us improve the time bound of the classic augmenting path algorithm to O(m + nv 3=2 ) on simple 
graphs. The addition of a blocking flow subroutine gives a 
simple, deterministic O(nm 2=3 v 1=6 )-time algorithm. We also 
use our technique to improve known randomized algorithms, 
giving O(m+nv 5=4 )-time and O(m+n 11=9 v)-time algorithms 
for capacitated undirected graphs. For simple graphs, in 
which v n, the last bound is O(n 2:2 ), improving on the best 
previous bound of O(n 2:5 ), which is also the best known time 
bound for bipartite matching.  </abstract>

<title> Bounds on the Time to Detect Failures 
Using Bounded-capacity Message Links  </title>
<author> Stephen Ponzio   </author>
<affiliation> MIT Laboratory for Computer Science  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
We consider a system of distributed processors that 
communicate by passing messages and that have inexact information about time. Specifically, a processor knows that a single message is delayed by at most 
time d and the time between any two of its consecutive steps is at least c 1 and at most c 2 ; it has no 
other way of estimating elapsed time. This simple 
model is very close to traditional models used in distributed computing theory, and has been studied by 
Attiya and Lynch [2, 1] among others. We extend 
the model by making a realistic assumption about 
how the delay of messages is affected by the rate at 
which they are sent. We define a model of message 
links with bounded capacity, which are guaranteed to 
deliver messages at only a given rate. If a processor sends messages at a greater rate, they may incur 
greater delay. 
We quantify the effect of this bounded capacity on 
the time necessary to detect processor failures. We 
consider a system of two processors connected by a 
bi-directional message link of (integral) capacity . 
First we give two very simple protocols that guarantee any stopping failure will be detected within 
time 2Cd + d and C 2 d= + Cd + d respectively, 
where C = c 2 =c 1 . The main result is an almost-matching lower bound of 2Cd+d= or C 2 d=+Cd+d, 
whichever is less. If the link is uni-directional, our result specializes to give a matching upper and lower 
bound of C 2 d= + Cd + d.  </abstract>

<title> The Design and Implementation of SOLAR, 
a Portable Library for Scalable Out-of-Core Linear Algebra Computations  </title>
<author> Sivan Toledo Fred G. Gustavson  </author>
<affiliation> IBM T.J. Watson Research Center  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
SOLAR is a portable high-performance library for out-of-core dense 
matrix computations. It combines portability with high performance 
by using existing high-performance in-core subroutine libraries and 
by using an optimized matrix input-output library. SOLAR works on 
parallel computers, workstations, and personal computers. It supports 
in-core computations on both shared-memory and distributed-memory 
machines, and its matrix input-output library supports both conventional I/O interfaces and parallel I/O interfaces. This paper discusses 
the overall design of SOLAR, its interfaces, and the design of several 
important subroutines. Experimental results show that SOLAR can 
factor on a single workstation an out-of-core positive-definite symmetric matrix at a rate exceeding 215 Mflops, and an out-of-core general 
matrix at a rate exceeding 195 Mflops. Less than 16% of the running 
time is spent on I/O in these computations. These results indicate 
that SOLAR's portability does not compromise its performance. We 
expect that the combination of portability, modularity, and the use of 
a high-level I/O interface will make the library an important platform 
for research on out-of-core algorithms and on parallel I/O.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We have implemented a prototype compiler called porch that transforms C programs into C programs supporting portable checkpoints. Portable checkpoints capture the state of a computation in 
a machine-independent format that allows the transfer of computations across binary incompatible machines. We introduce source-to-source compilation techniques for generating code to save and 
recover from such portable checkpoints automatically. These techniques instrument a program with code that maps the state of a computation into a machine-independent representation and vice versa. 
In particular, the following problems are addressed: (1) providing 
stack environment portability, (2) enabling conversion of complex 
data types, and (3) rendering pointers portable. Experimental results show that the overhead of checkpointing is reasonably small, 
even if data representation conversion is required for portability.  </abstract>

<title> Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso  </title>
<author> Robert Tibshirani   </author>
<affiliation> Department of Statistics

Division of Biostatistics

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The "lasso" 
minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute 
value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature 
of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero 
and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that 
the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection 
and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection 
and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting 
relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho 
and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a 
variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models 
and tree-based models are briefly described.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A new method for extracting planar polygonal rooftops in monocular aerial imagery is proposed. Through bottom-up and top-down construction of perceptual groups, polygons in a 
single aerial image can be robustly extracted. 
Orthogonal corners and lines are extracted and 
hierarchically related using perceptual grouping techniques. Top-down feature verification is 
used so that features, and links between the features, are verified with local information in the 
image and weighed in a graph structure according to the underlying support for each feature. 
Cycles in the graph correspond to possible 
building rooftop hypotheses. Virtual features 
are hypothesized for the perceptual completion 
of partial rooftops. Extraction of the "best" 
grouping of features into a building rooftop hypothesis is posed as a graph search problem. 
The maximally weighted, independent set of cycles in the graph is extracted as the final set of 
roof boundaries.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe a novel approach for image matching 
based on deformable intensity surfaces. In this 
approach, the intensity surface of the image 
is modeled as a deformable 3D mesh in the 
(x; ; I(x; )) space. Each surface point has 3 
degrees of freedom, thus capturing fine surface 
changes. A set of representative deformations 
within a class of objects (e.g. faces) are statistically learned through a Principal Components Analysis, thus providing a priori knowledge 
about object-specific deformations. We demonstrate the power of the approach by examples 
such as image matching and interpolation of 
missing data. Moreover this approach dramatically reduces the computational cost of solving 
the governing equation for the physically based 
system by approximately three orders of magni 
tude.

This paper presents a glove-free method for tracking 
hand movements using a set of 3-D models. In this 
approach, the hand is represented by five cylindrical 
models which are fit to the third phalangeal segments 
of the fingers. Six 3-D motion parameters for each 
model are calculated that correspond to the movement 
of the fingertips in the image plane. Trajectories of 
the moving models are then established to show the 3-D nature of hand motion.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Multi-chip module (MCM) packaging techniques present several new technical challenges, notably substrate testing. We formulate MCM substrate testing as a problem of connectivity verification in trees via k-probes, and present a linear-time algorithm which computes a minimum 
set of probes achieving complete open fault coverage. Since actual substrate testing also involves 
scheduling probe operations, we formulate efficient probe scheduling as a special type of metric 
traveling salesman optimization and give a provably-good heuristic. Empirical results using both 
random and industry benchmarks demonstrate reductions in testing costs of up to 21% over previous methods. We conclude with generalizations to alternate probe technologies and several open 
problems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
With fast switching speeds and large interconnect trees (MCMs), the 
resistance and inductance of interconnect has a dominant impact on 
logic gate delay. In this paper, we propose a new P model for distributed RC and RLC interconnects to estimate the driving point admittance at the output of a CMOS gate. Using this model we are able to 
compute the gate delay efficiently, within 25% of SPICE-computed delays. Our parameters depend only on total interconnect tree resistance 
and capacitance at the output of the gate. Previous effective load capacitance methods [7, 9], applicable only for distributed RC interconnects, are based on P model parameters obtained via a recursive admittance moment computation. Our model should be useful for iterative 
optimization of performance-driven routing or for estimation of gate 
delay and rise times in high-level synthesis.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
With submicron technologies, gate delays are dominated by gate 
load delays rather than intrinsic gate delays. While the common approach for computing gate load delay (or total gate delay) is through 
delay tables (or k-factor equations), there are important methodology problems associated with the delay table approach. In this paper, we propose a gate driver model with a Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of a ramp voltage source whose slew time is obtained 
from the gate slew tables, and a driver resistance in series with the 
gate load. We then develop analytical gate delay formulas using this 
Thevenin driver model and modeling the load with various gate load 
models under both rising and falling ramp input.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Increasingly popular reuse-based design paradigms create a pressing need for authorship enforcement techniques that protect the intellectual property rights of designers. We develop the first intellectual property protection protocols for embedding design watermarks at the physical design level. We demonstrate that these protocols are transparent with respect to existing industrial tools and 
design flows, and that they can embed watermarks into real-world 
industrial designs with very low implementation overhead (as measured by such standard metrics as wirelength, layout area, number 
of vias, routing congestion and CPU time). On several industrial 
test cases, we obtain extremely strong, tamper-resistant proofs of 
authorship for placement and routing solutions.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents general algorithms for concurrency control in 
tree-based access methods as well as a recovery protocol and a 
mechanism for ensuring repeatable read. The algorithms are developed in the context of the Generalized Search Tree (GiST) data 
structure, an index structure supporting an extensible set of queries 
and data types. Although developed in a GiST context, the algorithms are generally applicable to many tree-based access methods. 
The concurrency control protocol is based on an extension of the 
link technique originally developed for B-trees, and completely 
avoids holding node locks during I/Os. Repeatable read isolation is 
achieved with a novel combination of predicate locks and two-phase 
locking of data records. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 
isolation issues have been addressed outside the context of B-trees. 
A discussion of the fundamental structural differences between B-trees and more general tree structures like GiSTs explains why the 
algorithms developed here deviate from their B-tree counterparts. 
An implementation of GiSTs emulating B-trees in DB2/Common 
Server is underway.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. We present a new diagnostic algorithm, based on backward-propagation, for localising design 
errors in combinational logic circuits. Three hypotheses are considered, that cover all single gate replacement and insertion errors. Diagnosis-oriented test patterns are generated in order to rapidly reduce the 
suspected area where the error lies. The originality of our method is the use of patterns which do not 
detect the error, in addition to detecting patterns. A theorem shows that, in favourable cases, only two 
patterns suffice to get a correction. We have implemented the test generation and diagnosis algorithms. 
Results obtained on benchmarks show that the error is always found, after the application of a small 
number of test patterns, with an execution time proportional to the circuit size.  </abstract>

<affiliation> EECS Department, University of California at Berkeley, </affiliation> <address> CA 94720  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
The simulation preorder on state transition systems is widely accepted as a 
useful notion of refinement, both in its own right and as an efficiently checkable sufficient condition for trace containment. For composite systems, due to 
the exponential explosion of the state space, there is a need for decomposing a 
simulation check of the form P s Q into simpler simulation checks on the components of P and Q. We present an assume-guarantee rule that enables such a 
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first assume-guarantee 
rule that applies to a refinement relation different from trace containment. Our 
rule is circular, and its soundness proof requires induction on trace-trees. The 
proof is constructive: given simulation relations that witness the simulation 
preorder between components, we provide a procedure for constructing a witness relation for P s Q. We also extend our assume-guarantee rule to account 
for fairness assumptions on transition systems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rate and round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., a flow with an unlimited amount 
of data to send. Unlike the models in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behavior of TCP's fast 
retransmit mechanism (which is also considered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCP's timeout mechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling 
perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more timeout events than fast retransmit events. 
Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP throughput and is 
accurate over a wider range of loss rates.

<abstract> Abstract 
In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in workflow applications as a 
way of supporting complex business processes in modern corporations. Given the nature 
of the environment and the technology involved, workflow applications are inherently 
distributed and pose many interesting challenges to the system designer. In most cases, a 
client/server architecture is used in which knowledge about the processes being executed is 
centralized in one node to facilitate monitoring, auditing, and to simplify synchronization. 
In this paper, we explore a novel distributed architecture, Exotica/FMQM, for workflow 
systems in which the need for such a centralized database is eliminated. Instead, we use 
persistent messages as the means to store the information relevant to the execution of a 
business process. Our approach is to completely distribute the execution of a process so 
individual nodes are independent. The advantages of this approach are increased resilience 
to failures and greater scalability and flexibility of the system configuration.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
The problem of source 
identification involves correctly 
classifying an incoming signal into 
a category that identifies the 
signal's source. 
The problem is difficult because 
information is not provided 
distinguishing characteristics and 
because successive signals from the 
same source differ. The source 
identification problem can be made 
more difficult by dynamically 
changing the repertoire of sources 
while the problem is being solved. 
We used genetic programming to 
evolve both the topology and the 
sizing (numerical values) for each 
component of an analog electrical 
circuit that can correctly classify an 
incoming analog electrical signal 
into three categories. Then, the 
repertoire of sources was 
dynamically changed by adding a 
new source during the run. The 
paper describe show the 
enabled genetic programming to 
adapt, during the run, to the 
changed environment. Specifically, 
a three-way source identification 
circuit was evolved and then 
adapted into a four-way classifier, 
during the run, thereby successfully 
handling the additional new source.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Network throughput can be increased by allowing mul-tipath, adaptive routing. Adaptive routing allows more 
freedom in the paths taken by messages, spreading load 
over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of 
adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels 
[17]. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms which 
require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of network size and dimension. Planar-adaptive 
routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock 
prevention by reducing the number of choices at each 
routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adaptive 
networks are guaranteed to be deadlock-free. In the 
presence of network faults, the planar-adaptive router 
can be extended with misrouting to produce a working network which remains provably deadlock free and 
is provably livelock free. In addition, planar adaptive 
networks can simultaneously support both in-order and 
adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery. 
Planar-adaptive routing is of practical significance. It 
provides the simplest known support for deadlock-free 
adaptive routing in k-ary n-cubes of more than two 
dimensions (with k &gt; 2). Restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity, improving router speed 
or allowing additional performance-enhancing network 
features. The structure of planar-adaptive routers is 
amenable to efficient implementation.  </abstract>

Information retrieval differs significantly from function approximation in that the goal is for the system to achieve the same ranking

alienation, is the proper objective function for such a system, and 
demonstrate its efficacy by using it to find the optimal combination 
of retrieval experts. In application to a commercial retrieval system, 
the combination performs 47% better than any single expert.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Network bandwidth has always been a key issue for multimedia protocols. Many potential users of networked multimedia protocols will continue to have low bandwidth network 
connections for some time: copper wire ISDN, infra-red, cellular modems, etc.. Compression provides potential relief for users of slow networks by increasing effective bandwidth. 
HBX introduces a new technique, based on arithmetic coding and statistical modeling, for 
compressing structured data. Applied to the X networked graphics protocol, this technique 
yields 4.5:1 compression across a representative set of traces, performing twice as well as the 
popular LZW-based Xremote compression protocol. HBX's coding techniques are generally 
applicable to the graphics and imaging subset of multimedia protocols. Future work will 
determine whether HBX's coding techniques can be applied to audio and video streams as 
well.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Several existing volume rendering algorithms operate by factoring the viewing transformation into a 3D shear parallel to the data 
slices, a projection to form an intermediate but distorted image, 
and a 2D warp to form an undistorted final image. We extend 
this class of algorithms in three ways. First, we describe a new 
object-order rendering algorithm based on the factorization that is 
significantly faster than published algorithms with minimal loss 
of image quality. Shear-warp factorizations have the property that 
rows of voxels in the volume are aligned with rows of pixels in the 
intermediate image. We use this fact to construct a scanline-based 
algorithm that traverses the volume and the intermediate image in 
synchrony, taking advantage of the spatial coherence present in 
both. We use spatial data structures based on run-length encoding 
for both the volume and the intermediate image. Our implementation running on an SGI Indigo workstation renders a 256 3 voxel 
medical data set in one second. Our second extension is a shear-warp factorization for perspective viewing transformations, and 
we show how our rendering algorithm can support this extension. 
Third, we introduce a data structure for encoding spatial coherence 
in unclassified volumes (i.e. scalar fields with no precomputed 
opacity). When combined with our shear-warp rendering algorithm this data structure allows us to classify and render a 256 3 
voxel volume in three seconds. The method extends to support 
mixed volumes and geometry and is parallelizable.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents a progressive refinement algorithm for 
volume rendering which uses a pyramidal volume representation. Besides storing average values, the pyramid stores 
estimated error, so an oct-tree can be fit to the pyramid 
given a user-supplied precision. This oct-tree is then drawn 
using a set of splats, or footprints, each scaled to match the 
size of the projection of a cell. The splats themselves are approximated with RGBA Gouraud-shaded polygons, so that 
they can be drawn efficiently on modern graphics workstations. The result is a real-time rendering algorithm suitable 
for interactive applications.  </abstract>

<title> Compression Performance of the Xremote Protocol  </title>
<author> John Danskin Pat Hanrahan  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Science, Princeton University  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
The Xremote protocol is a compressed transformation of the X Window System protocol, 
designed to efficiently implement X connections across relatively slow serial lines. Using an 
Xremote simulator and 11 traces of X sessions, we found that Xremote's overall compression 
ratio is 2.4:1. This figure varies widely depending on the trace. A study of compression 
ratio as a function of message type shows text based messages commonly achieving 3:1 
compression, while geometric messages usually achieve only 1.6:1 compression. By examining bandwidth requirements and compression performance as a function of time, we see 
that Xremote performs adequately for some applications which are text based or which use 
small geometric datasets, except at application startup where more bandwidth is required. 
Further work is required to adequately support the initialization stage of X applications and 
medium to large geometric databases.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to identify and to characterize the features that render one class 
of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) computationally more efficient. Our approach 
is to search for a causal structure not only in the topology of the subsets of variables upon 
which the constraints are specified, but also in the nature of the constraints. Basically, there 
should exist an ordering of variables in the system such that an assignment of the variables 
can be reached without backtracking. First, an approach of a causal structure is formulated, 
and second, an efficient procedure is provided (i) for deciding if such an ordering of variables 
exists and, (ii) for identifying such an ordering whenever possible.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. The current vehicle-highway system has reached a plateau in its ability 
to meet the demand for moving goods and people. We sketch an architecture for 
an automated highway system or AHS. The architecture can be realized by several 
designs that differ in terms of performance and sophistication. We describe one design 
that could triple capacity and reduce travel time; guarantee collision-free operation 
in the absence of malfunctions; limit performance degradation in the case of faults; 
and reduce emissions by half. We summarize evidence suggesting that the design can 
be implemented. We indicate how the design can be adapted to different urban and 
rural scenarios and how a standard land use model can show the impact of AHS on 
urban density. We conclude with a critique of AHS.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents an approach to describing 
group behavior using simple local interactions 
among individuals. We propose that for a given 
domain a set of basic interactions can be defined 
which describes a large variety of group behaviors. 
The methodology we present allows for simplified 
qualitative analysis of group behavior through the 
use of shared goals, kin recognition, and minimal 
communication. We also demonstrate how these 
basic interactions can be simply combined into 
more complex compound group behaviors. 
To validate our approach we implemented an array of basic group behaviors in the domain of spatial interactions among homogeneous agents. We 
describe some of the experimental results from two 
distinct domains: a software environment, and a 
collection of 20 mobile robots. We also describe 
a compound behavior involving a combination of 
the basic interactions. Finally, we compare the 
performance of homogeneous groups to those of 
dominance hierarchies on the same set of basic behaviors.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: We exhibit a set of functions coded in 
Haskell that can be used as building blocks to construct 
a variety of interpreters for Lisp-like languages. The 
building blocks are joined merely through functional 
composition. Each building block contributes code to 
support a specific feature, such as numbers, continuations, functions calls, or nondeterminism. The result of 
composing some number of building blocks is a parser, 
an interpreter, and a printer that support exactly the 
expression forms and data types needed for the combined set of features, and no more. 
The data structures are organized as pseudomonads, 
a generalization of monads that allows composition. 
Functional composition of the building blocks implies 
type composition of the relevant pseudomonads. 
Our intent was that the Haskell type resolution system ought to be able to deduce the approprate data 
types automatically. Unfortunately there is a deficiency 
in current Haskell implementations related to recursive 
data types: circularity must be reflected statically in the 
type definitions. 
We circumvent this restriction by applying a purpose-built program simplifier that performs partial evaluation 
and a certain amount of program algebra. We construct 
a wide variety of interpreters in the style of Wadler by 
starting with the building blocks and a page of boiler-plate code, writing three lines of code (one to specify the 
building blocks and two to (redundantly) specify type 
compositions), and then applying the simplifier. The 
resulting code is acceptable Haskell code. 
We have tested a dozen different interpreters with 
various combinations of features. In this paper we discuss the overall code structuring strategy, exhibit several building blocks, briefly describe the partial evaluator, and present a number of automatically generated 
interpreters.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Multiple description coding (MDC) is source coding for multiple channels 
such that a decoder which receives an arbitrary subset of the channels may produce a useful reconstruction. Orchard et al. [1] proposed a transform coding 
method for MDC of pairs of independent Gaussian random variables. This paper provides a general framework which extends multiple description transform 
coding (MDTC) to any number of variables and expands the set of transforms 
which are considered. Analysis of the general case is provided, which can be 
used to numerically design optimal MDTC systems. The case of two variables 
sent over two channels is analytically optimized in the most general setting 
where channel failures need not have equal probability or be independent. It 
is shown that when channel failures are equally probable and independent, the 
transforms used in [1] are in the optimal set, but many other choices are possible. A cascade structure is presented which facilitates low-complexity design, 
coding, and decoding for a system with a large number of variables.  </abstract>

Analysis, Synthesis, and Algorithms  </title>
<author> Vivek K Goyal, Student Member, IEEE, Martin Vetterli, Fellow, IEEE, 
and Nguyen T. Thao, Member, IEEE  </author>
<abstract> Abstract|Coefficient quantization has peculiar qualitative 
effects on representations of vectors in R N with respect to 
overcomplete sets of vectors. These effects are investigated 
in two settings: frame expansions (representations obtained 
by forming inner products with each element of the set) 
and matching pursuit expansions (approximations obtained 
by greedily forming linear combinations). In both cases, 
based on the concept of consistency, it is shown that traditional linear reconstruction methods are suboptimal, and 
better consistent reconstruction algorithms are given. The 
proposed consistent reconstruction algorithms were in each 
case implemented, and experimental results are included. 
For frame expansions, results are proven to bound distortion as a function of frame redundancy r and quantization 
step size for linear, consistent, and optimal reconstruction 
methods. Taken together, these suggest that optimal reconstruction methods will yield O(1=r 2 ) MSE, and that consistency is sufficient to insure this asymptotic behavior. A 
result on the asymptotic tightness of random frames is also 
proven. 
Applicability of quantized matching pursuit to lossy vector compression is explored. Experiments demonstrate the 
likelihood that a linear reconstruction is inconsistent, the 
MSE reduction obtained with a nonlinear (consistent) reconstruction algorithm, and generally competitive performance 
at low bit rates.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Applications of learning to autonomous 
agents (simulated or real) have often been 
restricted to learning a mapping from perceived state of the world to the next action 
to take. Often this is couched in terms of 
learning from no previous knowledge. This 
general case for real autonomous robots is 
very difficult. In any case, when building a 
real robot there is usually a lot of a priori 
knowledge (e.g., from the engineering that 
went into its design) which doesn't need to 
be learned. We describe the behavior-based 
approach to autonomous robots, and then examine four classes of learning problems associated with such robots.  </abstract>

Predictions of lifetimes of dynamically allocated objects can be used 
to improve time and space efficiency of dynamic memory management in computer programs. Barrett and Zorn [1993] used a simple 
lifetime predictor and demonstrated this improvement on a variety 
of computer programs. In this paper, we use decision trees to do 
lifetime prediction on the same programs and show significantly 
better prediction. Our method also has the advantage that during 
training we can use a large number of features and let the decision 
tree automatically choose the relevant subset.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe a software package for computing and manipulating the subdivision of a sphere 
by a collection of (not necessarily great) circles and for computing the boundary surface of the 
union of spheres. We present problems that arise in the implementation of the software and the 
solutions that we have found for them. At the core of the paper is a novel perturbation scheme to 
overcome degeneracies and precision problems in computing spherical arrangements while using 
floating point arithmetic. The scheme is relatively simple, it balances between the efficiency 
of computation and the magnitude of the perturbation, and it performs well in practice. We 
report and discuss experimental results. Our package is a major component in a larger package 
aimed to support geometric queries on molecular models; it is currently employed by chemists 
working in `rational drug design.' The spherical subdivisions are used to construct a geometric 
model of a molecule where each sphere represents an atom. We also give an overview of the 
molecular modeling package and detail additional features and implementation issues.  </abstract>

not the specifics of this analysis are correct, it seems that the study of

<abstract> Abstract: We identify a new polynomial time decidable fragment of first order 
logic and present a general method for using polynomial time inference procedures 
in knowledge representation systems. Our results indicate that a non-standard 
"taxonomic" syntax is essential in constructing natural and powerful polynomial 
time inference procedures. The central role of taxonomic syntax in our polynomial time inference procedures provides technical support for the often expressed 
intuition that knowledge is better represented in terms of taxonomic relationships 
than classical first order formulas. To use our procedures in a knowledge representation system we define a "Socratic proof system" which is complete for first 
order inference and which can be used as a semi-automated interface to a first 
order knowledge base.  </abstract>

<title> Complex Feature Recognition: A 
Bayesian Approach for Learning to 
Recognize Objects  </title>
<author> Paul A. Viola  </author>
<note> This publication can be retrieved by anonymous ftp to publications.ai.mit.edu.  </note>
<abstract> Abstract 
We have developed a new Bayesian framework for visual object 
recognition which is based on the insight that images of objects can be 
modeled as a conjunction of local features. This framework can be used 
to both derive an object recognition algorithm and an algorithm for 
learning the features themselves. The overall approach, called complex 
feature recognition or CFR, is unique for several reasons: it is broadly 
applicable to a wide range of object types, it makes constructing object 
models easy, it is capable of identifying either the class or the identity 
of an object, and it is computationally efficient requiring time proportional to the size of the image. 
Instead of a single simple feature such as an edge, CFR uses a large 
set of complex features that are learned from experience with model 
objects. The response of a single complex feature contains much more 
class information than does a single edge. This significantly reduces the 
number of possible correspondences between the model and the image. 
In addition, CFR takes advantage of a type of image processing called 
oriented energy. Oriented energy is used to efficiently pre-process the 
image to eliminate some of the difficulties associated with changes in 
lighting and pose.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The maximization of diversity of neuronal response properties has been recently suggested 
as an organizing principle for the formation of such prominent features of the functional 
architecture of the brain as the cortical columns and the associated patchy projection patterns 
(Malach, 1994). We report a computational study of two aspects of this hypothesis. First, we 
show that maximal diversity is attained when the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes is 
equal to one, as it has been found in many cortical areas and across species (Lund et al., 1993; 
Malach, 1994). Second, we show that maximization of diversity leads to better performance in 
two case studies: in systems of receptive fields implementing steerable/shiftable filters, and in 
matching spatially distributed signals, a problem that arises in visual tasks such as stereopsis, 
motion processing, and recognition.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Several early game-playing computer programs used forward pruning (i.e., the practice of 
deliberately ignoring nodes that are believed unlikely to affect a game tree's minimax value), 
but this technique did not seem to result in good decision-making. The poor performance of 
forward pruning presents a major puzzle for AI research on game playing, because some version 
of forward pruning seems to be "what people do," and the best chess-playing programs still do 
not play as well as the best humans. 
As a step toward deeper understanding of how forward pruning affects quality of play, in 
this paper we set up a model of forward pruning on two abstract classes of binary game trees, 
and we use this model to investigate how forward pruning affects the accuracy of the minimax 
values returned. The primary result of our study is that forward pruning does better when there 
is a high correlation among the minimax values of sibling nodes in a game tree. 
This result suggests that forward pruning may possibly be a useful decision-making technique 
in certain kinds of games. In particular, we believe that bridge may be such a game.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Model-Based Optimization (MBO) is a paradigm in which an objective function is used to express 
both geometric and photometric constraints on features of interest. A parametric model of a feature 
(such as a road, a building, or coastline) is extracted from one or more images by adjusting the model's 
state variables until a minimum value of the objective function is obtained. The optimization procedure 
yields a description that simultaneously satisfies (or nearly satisfies) all constraints, and, as a result, is 
likely to be a good model of the feature.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe the design principles and functionality 
of a visual query language called SeeQL that represents data retrieval and analysis operations as a data-flow graph. A query is viewed as a sequence of relational algebra and other data transformation operations applied to database tables. The language is well-suited for large-scale scientific database applications, 
where data analysis is a major component and the typical queries or data retrieval patterns are unrestricted. 
The language provides a flexible yet easy-to-use environment for database access and data analysis for 
non-programmer research scientists. We have implemented this language in a system being used in a long-term data-intensive highway pavement research project 
(MnRoad) conducted by the Minnesota Department of 
Transportation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe an integrated problem solving architecture named INBANCA in 
which Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning (CBR) work cooperatively on 
multiagent planning tasks. This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper 
concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to 
implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations 
of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task 
decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration. 
Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental 
context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner.  </abstract>

<title> THE LOAD, CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY OF QUORUM 
SYSTEMS   </title>
<author> MONI NAOR AND AVISHAI WOOL   </author>
<abstract> Abstract. 
A quorum system is a collection of sets (quorums) every two of which intersect. Quorum systems 
have been used for many applications in the area of distributed systems, including mutual exclusion, 
data replication and dissemination of information 
Given a strategy to pick quorums, the load L(S) is the minimal access probability of the busiest 
element, minimizing over the strategies. The capacity Cap(S) is the highest quorum accesses rate 
that S can handle, so Cap(S) = 1=L(S). 
The availability of a quorum system S is the probability that at least one quorum survives, 
assuming that each element fails independently with probability p. A tradeoff between L(S) and the 
availability of S is shown. 
We present four novel constructions of quorum system, all featuring optimal or near optimal 
load, and high availability. The best construction, based on paths in a grid, has a load of O(1= 
p 
and a failure probability of exp(( 
p 
n)) when the elements fail with probability p &lt; 1 
2 . Moreover, 
even in the presence of faults, with exponentially high probability the load of this system is still 
O(1= 
n). The analysis of this scheme is based on Percolation Theory.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A data breakpoint associates debugging actions with 
programmer-specified conditions on the memory state 
of an executing program. Data breakpoints provide 
a means for discovering program bugs that are tedious or impossible to isolate using control breakpoints 
alone. In practice, programmers rarely use data break-points, because they are either unimplemented or prohibitively slow in available debugging software. In this 
paper, we present the design and implementation of a 
practical data breakpoint facility. 
A data breakpoint facility must monitor all memory 
updates performed by the program being debugged. 
We implemented and evaluated two complementary 
techniques for reducing the overhead of monitoring 
memory updates. First, we checked write instructions 
by inserting checking code directly into the program 
being debugged. The checks use a segmented bitmap 
data structure that minimizes address lookup complexity. Second, we developed data flow algorithms 
that eliminate checks on some classes of write instructions but may increase the complexity of the remaining 
checks. 
We evaluated these techniques on the Sparc using 
the spec benchmarks. Checking each write instruc  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
While plan recognition research has been applied to a 
wide variety of problems, it has largely made identical assumptions about the number of agents participating in the plan, the observability of the plan execution process, and the scale of the domain. We describe a method for plan recognition in a real-world 
domain involving large numbers of agents performing 
spatial maneuvers in concert under conditions of limited observability. These assumptions differ radically 
from those traditionally made in plan recognition and 
produce a problem which combines aspects of the fields 
of plan recognition, pattern recognition, and object 
tracking. We describe our initial solution which borrows and builds upon research from each of these areas, 
employing a pattern-directed approach to recognize individual movements and generalizing these to produce 
inferences of large-scale behavior.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Reactive controllers has been widely used in mobile robots since they are able to achieve successful performance in real-time. However, the configuration of a reactive controller depends 
highly on the operating conditions of the robot and the environment; thus, a reactive controller 
configured for one class of environments may not perform adequately in another. This paper 
presents a formulation of learning adaptive reactive controllers. Adaptive reactive controllers 
inherit all the advantages of traditional reactive controllers, but in addition they are able to adjust themselves to the current operating conditions of the robot and the environment in order to 
improve task performance. Furthermore, learning adaptive reactive controllers can learn when 
and how to adapt the reactive controller so as to achieve effective performance under different 
conditions. The paper presents an algorithm for a learning adaptive reactive controller that 
combines ideas from case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to construct a mapping 
between the operating conditions of a controller and the appropriate controller configuration; 
this mapping is in turn used to adapt the controller configuration dynamically. As a case 
study, the algorithm is implemented in a robotic navigation system that controls a Denning 
MRV-III mobile robot. The system is extensively evaluated using statistical methods to verify 
its learning performance and to understand the relevance of different design parameters on the 
performance of the system.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we develop a framework for comparing 
ontologies, and place a number of the more 
prominent ontologies into it. We have selected 10 
specific projects for this study, including general 
ontologies, domain specific ones, and one knowledge 
representation system. The comparison framework 
includes general characteristics such as the purpose of 
an ontology, its coverage (general or domain-specific), its size, and the formalism used. It also 
includes the design process used in creating an 
ontology and the methods used to evaluate it. 
Characteristics that describe the content of an 
ontology include taxonomic organization, types of 
concepts covered, top-level divisions, internal 
structure of concepts, representation of part-whole 
relations, and the presence and nature of additional 
axioms. Finally we consider what experiments or 
applications have used the ontologies. Knowledge 
sharing and reuse will require a common framework 
to support interoperability of independently created 
ontologies. Our study shows there is great diversity 
in the way ontologies are designed and the way they 
represent the world. By identifying the similarities 
and differences among existing ontologies, we clarify 
the range of alternatives in creating a standard 
framework for ontology design.  </abstract>

<abstract> Summary 
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for evaluating expectations of functions of interest 
under a target distribution . This is done by calculating averages over the sample path of a 
Markov chain having as its stationary distribution. For computational efficiency, the Markov 
chain should be rapidly mixing. This can sometimes be achieved only by careful design of the 
transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of . An 
alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of  
are encountered during the MCMC run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, the 
stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the 
concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often, but which 
does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample-path averages.  </abstract>

<title> RESONANCE AND THE PERCEPTION OF 
MUSICAL METER  </title>
<author> Edward W. Large

<affiliation> The Ohio State University  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
Many connectionist approaches to musical expectancy and music composition let the 
question of What next? overshadow the equally important question of When next?. One cannot 
escape the latter question, one of temporal structure, when considering the perception of musical 
meter. We view the perception of metrical structure as a dynamic process where the temporal 
organization of external musical events synchronizes, or entrains, a listeners internal processing 
mechanisms. This article introduces a novel connectionist unit, based upon a mathematical model 
of entrainment, capable of phase and frequency-locking to periodic components of incoming 
rhythmic patterns. Networks of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to 
rhythmic patterns. The resulting network behavior embodies the perception of metrical structure. 
The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our approach for theories of metrical 
structure and musical expectancy.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Advanced display technologies have made the virtual exploration of relatively complex models feasible 
in many applications. Unfortunately, only a few human interfaces allow natural interaction with the 
environment. Moreover, in surgical applications, such realistic interaction requires real-time rendering 
of volumetric data - placing an overwhelming performance burden on the system. We report on a 
collaboration of an interdisciplinary group developing a virtual reality system that provides intuitive 
interaction with volume data by employing real-time volume rendering and force feedback (haptic) 
sensations. We describe our rendering methods and the haptic devices and explain its utility of this 
system in the real-world application of Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) simulation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Grouping people into clusters based on the items they have purchased allows accurate recommendations of new items for purchase: 
if you and I have liked many of the same movies, then I will probably enjoy other movies that you like. Recommending items based 
on similarity of interest (a.k.a. collaborative filtering) is attractive 
for many domains: books, CDs, movies, etc., but does not always 
work well. Because data are always sparse any given person has 
seen only a small fraction of all movies much more accurate predictions can be made by grouping people into clusters with similar 
movies and grouping movies into clusters which tend to be liked by 
the same people. Finding optimal clusters is tricky because the movie 
groups should be used to help determine the people groups and visa 
versa. We present a formal statistical model of collaborative filtering, 
and compare different algorithms for estimating the model parameters 
including variations of K-means clustering and Gibbs Sampling. This 
formal model is easily extended to handle clustering of objects with 
multiple attributes.  </abstract>

<author> Rinaldo A. Jose and Lyle H. Ungar  </author>

<address> Philadelphia, PA 19104  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
Model predictive control strategies generally focus on controlling plant outputs to setpoints; in 
industry, however, a more desirable goal is maximizing a plants profitability. In principle, this can be 
done by creating a plant model and maximizing profit with respect to the market prices of the plants 
inputs and outputs, but in practice, such centralized approaches often cannot effectively be applied at 
the operations time scale due to the size and complexity of the problem. One solution is to use 
decentralized optimization at the unit operations level by tearing process streams and coordinating the 
resulting pieces. Such optimization, however, requires that unit inputs and outputs be priced. We show 
that a traditional Lagrangean-based approach to this pricing fails for simple systems. Instead, we define 
slack resources over the torn process streams and price them using auctions. Unlike Lagrange 
multipliers, slack resource prices contain useful information and can be used to make decisions 
regarding capital improvements, thus providing a strong tie between the operations and management 
layers in chemical plants.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Current input device taxonomies and other frameworks typically emphasize 
the mechanical structure of input devices. We suggest that selecting an 
appropriate input device for an interactive task requires looking beyond the 
physical structure of devices to the deeper perceptual structure of the task, the 
device, and the interrelationship between the perceptual structure of the task and 
the control properties of the device. We affirm that perception is key to 
understanding performance of multidimensional input devices on 
multidimensional tasks. We have therefore extended the theory of processing of 
perceptual structure to graphical interactive tasks and to the control structure of 
input devices. This allows us to predict task and device combinations that lead to 
better performance and hypothesize that performance is improved when the 
perceptual structure of the task matches the control structure of the device. We 
conducted an experiment in which subjects performed two tasks with different 
perceptual structures, using two input devices with correspondingly different 
control structures, a three-dimensional tracker and a mouse. We analyzed both 
speed and accuracy, as well as the trajectories generated by subjects as they used 
the unconstrained three-dimensional tracker to perform each task. The results 
support our hypothesis and confirm the importance of matching the perceptual 
structure of the task and the control structure of the input device.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Existing complexity measures from contemporary learning theory cannot be conveniently applied to specific learning problems (e.g., training sets). Moreover, they are typically non-generic, 
i.e., they necessitate making assumptions about the way in which the learner will operate. The lack 
of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers 
in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It 
shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which 
is associated with computational tractability. By determining which class a particular problem 
belongs to, we can thus effectively evaluate its degree of generic difficulty.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Let V and W be n-dimensional vector spaces over GF (2). A mapping 
Q : V ! W is called crooked if it satisfies the following three properties: 
Q(0) = 0; 
Q(x) + Q() + Q() + Q(x + + ) 6= 0 for any three distinct x; ; ; 
Q(x) + Q() + Q() + Q(x + a) + Q( + a) + Q( + a) 6= 0 if a 6= 0 (x; ;  
arbitrary). 
We show that every crooked function gives rise to a distance regular graph 
of diameter 3 having = 0 and = 2 which is a cover of the complete 
graph. Our approach is a generalization of a recent construction found by 
de Caen, Mathon, and Moorhouse. We study graph-theoretical properties of 
the resulting graphs, including their automorphisms. Also we demonstrate a 
connection between crooked functions and bent functions.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The use of music as a means to automate the sculpting and movement of graphical objects is investigated. An interactive environment for producing musically-controlled 
computer animations is presented. The graphical objects studied are based on Todd's 
and Latham's work in evolutionary art. The environment permits the creation of kernel objects using an interactive toolset. In addition to a basic set of morphological 
definitions, each object incorporates a script, which is an instance of programming 
language code and data definitions. Scripts permit the run-time computation of object characteristics, and when done in a temporal setting, allow complex animation 
control. The script language has a number of functions that can access MIDI information, as read into the system via a MIDI file. The practical consequence of this 
is that animations are controllable with music data, in which music determines the 
movement and morphology of animated objects. The tight integration of music and 
animation in an interactive production environment such as this one has a number 
of pragmatic consequences, ranging from the ability to automatically synchronize 
complex activities to music, to the use of music as a creative source for graphical 
sculptoring and animation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Summary 
This article presents a software-only solution to the synchronization problem for uniprocessors. 
The idea is to execute atomic sequences without any hardware protection, and in the rare case 
of pre-emption, to roll the sequence forward to the end, thereby preserving atomicity. One of 
the proposed implementations protects atomic sequences without any memory-accesses. This 
is significant as it enables execution at CPU-speeds, rather than memory-speeds. The benefit of 
this method increases with the frequency at which atomic sequences are executed. It therefore 
encourages the building of systems with fine-grained synchronization. This has the additional 
advantage of reducing average latency. Experiments demonstrate that this technique has the 
potential to outperform even the best hardware mechanisms. The main contribution of this article 
is to discuss operating-system related issues of rollforward and to demonstrate its practicality, 
both in terms of flexibility and performance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Conventional software radios take advantage of vastly improved A/D converters and DSP hardware. Our 
approach, which we refer to as virtual radios, also depends upon high performance A/D converters. However, 
rather than use DSPs, we have chosen to ride the curve of rapidly improving workstation hardware. We use 
wideband digitization and then perform all of the digital signal processing in user space on a general purpose 
workstation. This approach allows us to experiment with new approaches to signal processing that exploit the 
hardware and software resources of the workstation. Furthermore, it allows us to experiment with different 
ways of structuring systems in which the radio component of communication devices are integrated with 
higher-level applications. 
This paper describes the design and performance of an environment we have constructed that facilitates building virtual radios and of two applications built using that environment. The environment consists of an I/O 
subsystem that provides high bandwidth low latency user-level access to digitized signals and a programming 
environment that provides an infrastructure for building applications. The applications, which exemplify 
some of the benefits of virtual radios, are a software cellular receiver and a novel wireless network interface.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Myrinet is a new type of local-area network (LAN) based on the 
technology used for packet communication and switching within "massively-parallel processors" (MPPs). Think of Myrinet as an MPP message-passing 
network that can span campus dimensions, rather than as a wide-area 
telecommunications network that is operating in close quarters. The 
technical steps toward making Myrinet a reality included the development 
of (1) robust, 25m communication channels with flow control, packet 
framing, and error control; (2) self-initializing, low-latency, cut-through 
switches; (3) host interfaces that can map the network, select routes, and 
translate from network addresses to routes, as well as handle packet traffic; 
and (4) streamlined host software that allows direct communication 
between user processes and the network.  </abstract>

the system used to manage memory, as well as providing an implementation that fit well

<abstract> Abstract: 
Modern operating systems provide a rich set of interfaces for mapping, sharing, and protecting memory. Different 
memory management unit (MMU) architectures provide different mechanisms for managing memory translations. 
Since the same OS usually runs on different MMU architectures, a software hardware address translation (hat) 
layer that abstracts the MMU architecture is normally implemented between MMU hardware and the virtual memory system of the OS. In this paper, we study the impact of the OS and the MMU on the structure and performance 
of the hat layer. In particular, we concentrate on the role of the hat layer on the scalability of system performance 
on symmetric multiprocessors with 2-12 CPUs. The results show that, unlike single-user applications, multi-user 
applications require very careful multi-threading of the hat layer to achieve system performance that scales with 
the number of CPUs. In addition, multi-threading the hat can result in better performance in lesser amounts of 
physical memory.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The correspondence problem in computer vision is basically a matching task between two or more sets of features. In this paper, we introduce a vectorized image 
representation, which is a feature-based representation 
where correspondence has been established with respect 
to a reference image. The representation consists of two 
image measurements made at the feature points: shape 
and texture. Feature geometry, or shape, is represented 
using the (x; ) locations of features relative to the some 
standard reference shape. Image grey levels, or texture, 
are represented by mapping image grey levels onto the 
standard reference shape. Computing this representation 
is essentially a correspondence task, and in this paper 
we explore an automatic technique for "vectorizing" face 
images. Our face vectorizer alternates back and forth 
between computation steps for shape and texture, and a 
key idea is to structure the two computations so that each 
one uses the output of the other. In addition to describing the vectorizer, an application to the problem of facial 
feature detection will be presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Multipol is a library of distributed data structures designed for irregular applications, including those with asynchronous communication patterns. In this paper, 
we describe the Multipol runtime layer, which provides an efficient and portable abstraction underlying the data structures. It contains a thread system to express 
computations with varying degrees of parallelism and to support multiple threads 
per processor for hiding communication latency. To simplify programming in a mul-tithreaded environment, Multipol threads are small, finite-length computations that 
are executed atomically. Rather than enforcing a single scheduling policy on threads, 
users may write their own schedulers or choose one of the schedulers provided by 
Multipol. The system is designed for distributed memory architectures and performs 
communication optimizations such as message aggregation to improve efficiency on 
machines with high communication startup overhead. The runtime system currently 
runs on the Thinking Machines CM5, Intel Paragon, and IBM SP1, and is being 
ported to a network of workstations. Multipol applications include an event-driven 
timing simulator [1], an eigenvalue solver [2], and a program that solves the phylogeny 
problem [3].  </abstract>

<title> Narrowing Interval Bounds  </title>
<abstract> 1. Abstract 
Interval arithmetic is an automated attempt to give guaranteed upper and lower bounds of a numerical 
computation in the face of uncertainly in the input data and floating point roundoff during the calculation. 
While a simple interval equivalent of a rational function can be readily synthesized, the bounds from this 
construction may be too pessimistically large to be useful. This paper surveys a variety of techniques for 
refining the interval bounds. An appendix identifies issues with realizing floating point based interval 
arithmetic on current IEEE 754 compliant processors.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present an approach for creating realistic synthetic views of existing architectural 
scenes from a sparse set of still photographs. Our approach, which combines both geometry-based and image-based modeling and rendering techniques, has two components. The first 
component is an easy-to-use photogrammetric modeling system which facilitates the recovery of a basic geometric model of the photographed scene. The modeling system is effective 
and robust because it exploits the constraints that are characteristic of architectural scenes. 
The second component is a model-based stereo algorithm, which recovers how the real scene 
deviates from the basic model. By making use of the model, our stereo approach can robustly 
recover accurate depth from image pairs with large baselines. Consequently, our approach 
can model large architectural environments with far fewer photographs than current image-based modeling approaches. As an intermediate result, we present view-dependent texture 
mapping, a method of better simulating geometric detail on basic models. Our approach 
can recover models for use in either geometry-based or image-based rendering systems. We 
present results that demonstrate our approach's abilty to create realistic renderings of architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the original photographs.

<abstract> Abstract. Object-Relational and Object-Oriented DBMSs allow 
users to invoke time-consuming (expensive) methods in their 
queries. When queries containing these expensive methods are run 
on data with duplicate values, time is wasted redundantly computing methods on the same value. This problem has been studied in 
the context of programming languages, where memoization is the 
standard solution. In the database literature, sorting has been proposed to deal with this problem. We compare these approachesalong 
with a third solution, a variant of unary hybrid hashing which we call 
Hybrid Cache. We demonstrate that Hybrid Cache always dominates memoization, and significantly outperforms sorting in many 
instances. This provides new insights into the tradeoff between hashing and sorting for unary operations. Additionally, our Hybrid Cache 
algorithm includes some new optimizations for unary hybrid hashing, which can be used for other applications such as grouping and 
duplicate elimination. We conclude with a discussion of techniques 
for caching multiple expensive methods in a single query, and raise 
some new optimization problems in choosing caching techniques.  </abstract>

<address> Berkeley, CA 94720  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes a practical path planner for 
nonholonomic robots in environments with obstacles. 
The planner is based on building a one-dimensional, 
maximal clearance skeleton through the configuration 
space of the robot. However rather than using the Eu-clidean metric to determine clearance, a special metric 
which captures information about the nonholonomy of 
the robot is used. The robot navigates from start to 
goal states by loosely following the skeleton; the resulting paths taken by the robot are of low "complexity." 
We describe how much of the computation can be done 
off-line once and for all for a given robot, making for 
an efficient planner. The focus is on path planning 
for mobile robots, particularly the planar two-axle car, 
but the underlying ideas are quite general and may be 
applied to planners for other nonholonomic robots.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The relative slowdown of DRAMs with respect to 
processor speeds and the widespread use of SMP 
machines have bolstered the reliance on processor caches 
to provide good performance. As a result, optimizing 
machines and software for caches have recently received 
more attention. In addition, with the popularity of 
extensible computing, which includes the object oriented 
programming style, shared libraries, and Java based 
computing, creating effective compilers has become 
more challenging, with an increased reliance on more 
dynamic techniques, such as profiling and runtime code 
generation. This paper proposes a dynamic optimization 
method called cache windowing to reduce conflict misses 
in L1 instruction caches. Using a combination of 
hardware and software support, cache windowing 
integrates a RollCache (a direct-mapped cache enhanced 
to support dynamic cache configuration) and a software 
implemented FIFO caching policy. Together, both allow 
a program to reposition procedures, dynamically and 
efficiently, to eliminate cache conflicts. Experiments 
show that this type of caching scheme can achieve miss 
rates competitive to a 2-way set associative cache for 
various programs. Currently, a high software overhead 
exists to support a software caching policy, though 
different compiler optimizations, such as inlining, may 
help to reduce this. Such a system provides a more robust 
runtime architecture that, potentially, may adapt better to 
a wider variety of environments.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of belief changehow an agent should revise her beliefs upon learning new 
informationhas been an active area of research in both philosophy and artificial intelligence. 
Many approaches to belief change have been proposed in the literature. Our goal is not to 
introduce yet another approach, but to examine carefully the rationale underlying the approaches 
already taken in the literature, and to highlight what we view as methodological problems in the 
literature. The main message is that to study belief change carefully, we must be quite explicit 
about the ontology or scenario underlying the belief change process. This is something that 
has been missing in previous work, with its focus on postulates. Our analysis shows that we 
must pay particular attention to two issues which have often been taken for granted: The first 
is how we model the agent's epistemic state. (Do we use a set of beliefs, or a richer structure, 
such as an ordering on worlds? And if we use a set of beliefs, in what language are these 
beliefs are expressed?) The second is the status of observations. (Are observations known to 
be true, or just believed? In the latter case, how firm is the belief?) For example, we argue that 
even postulates that have been called beyond controversy are unreasonable when the agent's 
beliefs include beliefs about her own epistemic state as well as the external world. Issues of the 
status of observations arise particularly when we consider iterated belief revision, and we must 
confront the possibility of revising by ' and then by :'.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Conditional logics play an important role in recent attempts 
to investigate default reasoning. This paper investigates first-order conditional logic. We show that, as for first-order 
probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as most birds fly), 
and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as I 
believe that Tweety is unlikely to fly). We then address 
the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional 
logic. As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics. To study the problem in a coherent way, we 
use plausibility structures. These provide us with a general 
framework in which many of the standard approaches can be 
embedded. We show that while these standard approaches 
are all the same at the propositional level, they are significantly different in the context of a first-order language. We 
show that plausibilities provide the most natural extension of 
conditional logic to the first-order case: We provide a sound 
and complete axiomatization that contains only the KLM 
properties and standard axioms of first-order modal logic. 
We show that most of the other approaches have additional 
properties, which result in an inappropriate treatment of an 
infinitary version of the lottery paradox.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Multi-threaded programming is difficult and error prone. It 
is easy to make a mistake in synchronization that produces a 
data race, yet it can be extremely hard to locate this mistake 
during debugging. This paper describes a new tool, called 
Eraser, for dynamically detecting data races in lock-based 
multi-threaded programs. Eraser uses binary rewriting techniques to monitor every shared memory reference and verify 
that consistent locking behavior is observed. We present several case studies, including undergraduate coursework and a 
multi-threaded Web search engine, that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We report the performance of NOW-Sort, a collection of sorting implementations on a Network of Workstations (NOW). 
We find that parallel sorting on a NOW is competitive to sorting on the large-scale SMPs that have traditionally held the 
performance records. On a 64-node cluster, we sort 6.0 GB 
in just under one minute, while a 32-node cluster finishes the 
Datamation benchmark in 2.41 seconds. 
Our implementations can be applied to a variety of disk, 
memory, and processor configurations; we highlight salient 
issues for tuning each component of the system. We evaluate the use of commodity operating systems and hardware for 
parallel sorting. We find existing OS primitives for memory 
management and file access adequate. Due to aggregate communication and disk bandwidth requirements, the bottleneck 
of our system is the workstation I/O bus.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present an implementation of a Fast Fourier Transform on Vector Intelligent RAM architecture. The algorithm computes the Discrete 
Fourier Transform in O(N log N) time, is self-sorting (no bit-reversed copy 
phase is required), and has a minimum vector length of 
p 
N=2, where N is 
the number of data points in the transform. An N-element scratch space 
is required. The performance of this algorithm on VIRAM is analyzed 
against two variants of the Stockham [12] algorithm.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper examines the plausibility of using a network of 
workstations (NOW) for a mixture of parallel and sequential 
jobs. Through simulations, our study examines issues that arise 
when combining these two workloads on a single platform. Starting from a dedicated NOW just for parallel programs, we incrementally relax uniprogramming restrictions until we have a 
multi-programmed, multi-user NOW for both interactive sequential users and parallel programs. We show that a number of issues 
associated with the distributed NOW environment (e.g., daemon 
activity, coscheduling skew) can have a small but noticeable effect on parallel program performance. We also find that efficient 
migration to idle workstations is necessary to maintain acceptable parallel application performance. Furthermore, we present a 
methodology for deriving an optimal delay time for recruiting idle 
machines for use by parallel programs; this recruitment threshold 
was just 3 minutes for the research cluster we measured. Finally, 
we quantify the effects of the additional parallel load upon interactive users by keeping track of the potential number of user 
delays in our simulations. When we limit the maximum number 
of delays per user, we can still maintain acceptable parallel program performance. In summary, we find that for our workloads a 
2:1 rule applies: a NOW cluster of approximately 60 machines can 
sustain a 32-node parallel workload in addition to the sequential 
load placed upon it by interactive users.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem 
for linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems. 
We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need for 
listing of compounds in the lexicon. We argue that the development of a practical model of 
compound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design. The Generative Lexicon 
(Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples sufficiently expressive 
lexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between those 
representations and their syntactic expression. In our approach, the qualia structures of the 
nouns in a compound provide relational structure enabling compositional interpretation of the 
modification of the head noun by the modifying noun. This brings compound interpretation 
under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument 
selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995). 
We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which use 
phrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representation 
and syntactic expression. In addition to applications in natural language understanding, machine 
translation, and generation, the model of compound interpretation developed here can be applied 
to multi-lingual information extraction tasks.  </abstract>

<title> Stochastic Interaction and Linear Logic  </title>
<author> Patrick D. Lincoln John C. Mitchell Andre Scedrov x  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present stochastic interactive semantics for propositional linear 
logic without modalities. The framework is based on interactive 
protocols considered in computational complexity theory, in which 
a prover with unlimited power interacts with a verifier that can 
only toss fair coins or perform simple tasks when presented with 
the given formula or with subsequent messages from the prover. 
The additive conjunction & is described as random choice, which 
reflects the intuitive idea that the verifier can perform only "random spot checks". This stochastic interactive semantic framework 
is shown to be sound and complete. Furthermore, the prover's 
winning strategies are basically proofs of the given formula. In 
this framework the multiplicative and additive connectives of linear logic are described by means of probabilistic operators, giving a 
new basis for intuitive reasoning about linear logic and a potential 
new tool in automated deduction.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we present an extensive experimental study comparing three general-purpose graph 
drawing algorithms. The three algorithms take as 
input general graphs (with no restrictions whatsoever on the connectivity, planarity, etc.) and construct orthogonal grid drawings, which are widely 
used in software and database visualization applications. The test data (available by anonymous 
ftp) are 11,582 graphs, ranging from 10 to 100 
vertices, which have been generated from a core 
set of 112 graphs used in "real-life" software engineering and database applications. The experiments provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of 
the performance of the three algorithms, and show 
that they exhibit trade-offs between "aesthetic" 
properties (e.g., crossings, bends, edge length) and 
running time. The observed practical behavior of 
the algorithms is consistent with their theoretical 
properties.

<abstract> Abstract 
Relational database systems and most object-oriented database systems provide support for queries. 
Usually these queries represent retrievals over sets or 
multisets. Many new applications for databases, such 
as multimedia systems and digital libraries, need support for queries on complex bulk types such as lists 
and trees. In this paper we describe an object-oriented 
query algebra for lists and trees. The operators in the 
algebra preserve the ordering between the elements of a 
list or tree, even when the result list or tree contains an 
arbitrary set of nodes from the original tree. We also 
present predicate languages for lists and trees which 
allow order-sensitive queries because they use pattern 
matching to examine groups of list or tree nodes rather 
than individual nodes. The ability to decompose predicate patterns enables optimizations that make use of 
indices.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper is concerned with modeling 
planning problems involving uncertainty as 
discrete-time, finite-state stochastic automata. 
Solving planning problems is reduced to computing policies for Markov decision processes. 
Classical methods for solving Markov decision 
processes cannot cope with the size of the 
state spaces for typical problems encountered 
in practice. As an alternative, we investigate 
methods that decompose global planning problems into a number of local problems, solve the 
local problems separately, and then combine 
the local solutions to generate a global solution. We present algorithms that decompose 
planning problems into smaller problems given 
an arbitrary partition of the state space. The 
local problems are interpreted as Markov decision processes and solutions to the local problems are interpreted as policies restricted to the 
subsets of the state space defined by the partition. One algorithm relies on constructing and 
solving an abstract version of the original decision problem. A second algorithm iteratively 
approximates parameters of the local problems 
to converge to an optimal solution. We show 
how properties of a specified partition affect the 
time and storage required for these algorithms.  </abstract>

<title> LOCALIZED TEMPORAL REASONING USING SUBGOALS

<author> Shieu-Hong Lin, Thomas Dean 1  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Science, Brown University, </affiliation> <address> Providence, RI 02912  </address>
<abstract> We are concerned with temporal reasoning problems where there is uncertainty about the order 
in which events occur. The task of temporal reasoning is to derive an event sequence consistent with 
a given set of ordering constraints to achieve a goal. Previous research shows that the associated 
decision problems are hard even for very restricted cases. In this paper, we investigate locality in 
event ordering and causal dependencies. We present a localized temporal reasoning algorithm that 
uses subgoals and abstract events to exploit locality. The computational efficiency of our algorithm 
for a problem instance is quantified by the inherent locality in the instance. We theoretically 
demonstrate the substantial improvement in performance gained by exploiting locality. This work 
provides a solid evidence of the usefulness of localized reasoning in exploiting locality.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We investigate the use of temporally abstract 
actions, or macro-actions, in the solution of 
Markov decision processes. Unlike current models that combine both primitive actions and 
macro-actions and leave the state space unchanged, we propose a hierarchical model (using 
an abstract MDP) that works with macro-actions 
only, and that significantly reduces the size of the 
state space. This is achieved by treating macro-actions as local policies that act in certain regions 
of state space, and by restricting states in the abstract MDP to those at the boundaries of regions. 
The abstract MDP approximates the original and 
can be solved more efficiently. We discuss several ways in which macro-actions can be generated to ensure good solution quality. Finally, 
we consider ways in which macro-actions can be 
reused to solve multiple, related MDPs; and we 
show that this can justify the computational over 
head of macro-action generation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper investigates the power of genetic algorithms at solving the MAX-CLIQUE problem. We measure the performance of a standard genetic algorithm on an elementary set of 
problem instances consisting of embedded cliques in random graphs. We indicate the need 
for improvement, and introduce a new genetic algorithm, the multi-phase annealed GA, which 
exhibits superior performance on the same problem set. 
As we scale up the problem size and test on "hard" benchmark instances, we notice a 
degraded performance in the algorithm caused by premature convergence to local minima. To 
alleviate this problem, a sequence of modifications are implemented ranging from changes in 
input representation to systematic local search. The most recent version, called union GA, 
incorporates the features of union cross-over, greedy replacement, and diversity enhancement. 
It shows a marked speed-up in the number of iterations required to find a given solution, as well 
as some improvement in the clique size found. 
We discuss issues related to the SIMD implementation of the genetic algorithms on a Thinking Machines CM-5, which was necessitated by the intrinsically high time complexity (O(n 3 )) 
of the serial algorithm for computing one iteration. 
Our preliminary conclusions are: (1) a genetic algorithm needs to be heavily customized to 
work "well" for the clique problem; (2) a GA is computationally very expensive, and its use is 
only recommended if it is known to find larger cliques than other algorithms; (3) although our 
customization effort is bringing forth continued improvements, there is no clear evidence, at this 
time, that a GA will have better success in circumventing local minima.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Mitchell defined and axiomatized a subtyping relationship (also known 
as containment, coercibility, or subsumption) over the types of System F 
(with "!" and "8"). This subtyping relationship is quite simple and does 
not involve bounded quantification. Tiuryn and Urzyczyn quite recently 
proved this subtyping relationship to be undecidable. This paper supplies a new undecidability proof for this subtyping relationship. First, a 
new syntax-directed axiomatization of the subtyping relationship is defined. Then, this axiomatization is used to prove a reduction from the 
undecidable problem of semi-unification to subtyping. The undecidability of subtyping implies the undecidability of type checking for System F 
extended with Mitchell's subtyping, also known as "F plus eta".  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The purpose of these notes is to describe some of the physical and mathematical properties 
of the equations occurring in global illumination. We first examine the physical assumptions 
that make the particle model of light an appropriate paradigm for computer graphics and 
then derive a balance equation for photons. In doing this we establish connections with the 
field of radiative transfer and its more abstract counterpart, transport theory. The resulting 
balance equation, known as the equation of transfer, accounts for large-scale interaction 
of light with participating media as well as complex reflecting surfaces. Under various 
simplifying assumptions the equation of transfer reduces to more conventional equations 
encountered in global illumination.  </abstract>

a tooth model has to be scanned from several directions with a 3D-laser scanner. Several 
views are necessary because of shadows and occluded areas in the range images. Then, 
all acquired range views are combined to build a CAD-model of the tooth. The idea is 
that every part of the surface should be visible in at least one view. The reconstruction 
process is divided into the steps registration, volume sculpturing and generation of an 
accurate polygonal representation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Industrial assembly involves sensing the pose (orientation and position) of a part. Efficient and reliable 
sensing strategies can be developed for an assembly 
task if the shape of the part is known in advance. In 
this paper we investigate the problem of determining 
the pose of a convex n-gon from a set of m supporting 
cones, i.e., cones with both sides supporting the polygon. An algorithm with running time O(nm) which 
almost always reduces to O(n + m log n) is presented 
to solve for all possible poses of the polygon. As a consequence, the polygon inscription problem of finding all 
possible poses for a convex n-gon inscribed in another 
convex m-gon, can be solved within the same asymptotic time bound. We prove that the number of possible poses cannot exceed 6n, given m 2 supporting 
cones with distinct vertices. Experiments demonstrate 
that two supporting cones are sufficient to determine 
the real pose of the n-gon in most cases. 
Our results imply that sensing in practice can be 
carried out by obtaining viewing angles of a planar 
part at multiple exterior sites in the plane. As a conclusion, we generalize this and other sensing methods 
into a scheme named sensing by inscription.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient 
domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we 
present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The 
approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to 
numerically track the ``ow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise 
role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given 
example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair awed elements of the theory. 
PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown 
experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: 
Current and emerging real-time and multimedia applications like multi-party collaboration, internet telephony and 
distributed command control systems require the exchange of information over distributed and heterogeneous nodes. 
Multiple data types including voice, video, sensor data, real-time intelligence data and text are being transported 
widely across today's information, control and surveillance networks. All such applications can benefit enormously 
from middleware, operating system and networking services that can support QoS guarantees, high availability, 
dynamic reconfigurability and scalability. 
In this paper, we propose a middleware layer called a "Real-Time Push-Pull Communications Service" to easily and quickly disseminate information across heterogeneous nodes with an underlying architecture to satisfy the 
above-mentioned requirements. Push-Pull Communications is an extension of the real-time publisher/subscriber 
model [4], and represents both "push" (data transfer initiated by a sender) and "pull" (data transfer initiated by a 
receiver) communications. Nodes with widely differing processing power and networking bandwidth can coordinate 
and co-exist by the provision of appropriate and automatic support for transformation on data and supports scaling. 
Different information sources and sinks can operate at different frequencies and also can choose another (intermedi-ate) node to act as their proxy and and deliver data at the desired frequency. This service has been implemented 
on RT-Mach, a resource-centric kernel using resource kernel primitives [7]. This paper presents an overview of the 
design, implementation and preliminary performance evaluation of the model.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing tries to select a path that satisfies a set of 
QoS constraints, while also achieving overall network resource efficiency. We 
present initial results on QoS path selection for traffic requiring bandwidth 
and delay guarantees. For traffic with bandwidth guarantees, we found that 
several routing algorithms that favor paths with fewer hops perform well. For 
traffic with delay guarantees, we show that for a broad class of WFQ-like 
scheduling algorithms, the problem of finding a path satisfying bandwidth, 
delay, delay-jitter, and/or buffer space constraints while at the same time 
deriving the bandwidth that has to be reserved to meet these constraints, is 
solvable by a modified version of the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm 
in polynomial time.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Abstraction is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem 
solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description as 
used in most hierarchical planners has proven useful. In this paper we present examples 
which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome 
these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of 
representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related 
sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation 
language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful 
change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which 
describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. 
This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement 
in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically 
learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning 
in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from 
abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The FAA Aging Aircraft Research Program is 
supporting the development of a robotic mobile 
nondestructive inspection (NDI) instrument 
deployment tool at Carnegie Mellon University 
(CMU) with the active participation of USAir. The 
program has spawned several new relationships 
and entities: an alliance with an ARPA-funded 
research program at CMU having the capability to 
add 3D-stereoscopic enhanced visual inspection 
capability, a start-up company organized to 
commercialize the combined technologies, and 
State of Pennsylvania funding to foster this 
commercialization. As a result of these activities 
and connections the civilian sector appears to be 
ahead of the military sector in important aspects of 
automation for deployment of aircraft inspection 
equipment. A partnership between the university 
researchers, the airline operator, the start-up 
company, and the state government is thus 
emerging as the likely agent for transfer of the 
civilian-developed technology to the military sector.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Because the World Wide Web consists primarily of 
text, information extraction is central to any effort that 
would use the Web as a resource for knowledge discovery. We show how information extraction can be cast 
as a standard machine learning problem, and argue for 
the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The 
implementation of a general-purpose relational learner 
for information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document 
structure and the kinds of information available for use 
in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and 
other information is supplied as input in the form of an 
extensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstrate 
the effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV for 
use in learning extraction rules for a domain consisting 
of university course and research project pages sampled 
from the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involves 
adding several simple HTML-specific features to its basic feature set.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
We present an overview of Candide, a system for automatic 
translation of French text to English text. Candide uses 
methods of information theory and statistics to develop a 
probability model of the translation process. This model, 
which is made to accord as closely as possible with a large 
body of French and English sentence pairs, is then used to 
generate English translations of previously unseen French 
sentences. This paper provides a tutorial in these methods, 
discussions of the training and operation of the system, and 
a summary of test results.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. The design of linear logic programming languages and theorem provers opens a number of new implementation challenges not 
present in more traditional logic languages such as Horn clauses (Prolog) 
and hereditary Harrop formulas (Prolog). Among these, the problem of 
efficiently managing the linear context when solving a goal is of crucial 
importance for the use of these systems in non-trivial applications. This 
paper studies this problem in the case of Lolli [6] (though its results have 
application to other systems). We first give a proof-theoretic presentation of the operational semantics of this language as a resolution calculus. 
We then present a series of resource management systems designed to 
eliminate the non-determinism in the distribution of linear formulas that 
undermines the efficiency of a direct implementation of this system.  </abstract>

<title> Fast Probabilistic Modeling for Combinatorial Optimization  </title>
<abstract> Abstract 
Probabilistic models have recently been utilized for the optimization of large combinatorial search problems. However, 
complex probabilistic models that attempt to capture inter-parameter dependencies can have prohibitive computational 
costs. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed 
COMIT, provides a method for using probabilistic models in 
conjunction with fast search techniques. We show how 
COMIT can be used with two very different fast search algorithms: hillclimbing and Population-based incremental 
learning (PBIL). The resulting algorithms maintain many of 
the benefits of probabilistic modeling, with far less computational expense. Extensive empirical results are provided; 
COMIT has been successfully applied to jobshop scheduling, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems. This paper 
also presents a review of probabilistic modeling for combi 
natorial optimization.  </abstract>

<title> New Approximation Techniques for Some Ordering Problems  </title>
<author> Satish Rao Andrea W. Richa   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We describe logarithmic times optimal approximation 
algorithms for the NP-hard graph optimization problems of minimum linear arrangement, minimum containing interval graph, and minimum storage-time 
product. This improves on the best previous approximation bounds of Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber for 
these problems by an (log log n) factor. 
Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber defined "spreading 
metrics" for each of the ordering problems above (and 
to other problems); for each of these problems, they 
provided a spreading metric of volume W , such that W 
is a lower bound on the cost of a solution to the problem. 
They used this spreading metric to find a solution of 
cost O(W log n log log n) (for simplicity, assume that 
all tasks have unit processing time in the minimum 
storage-time product problem). In this paper, we show 
how to find a solution within a logarithmic factor times 
W for these problems. 
We develop a recursion where at each level we 
identify cost which, if incurred, yields subproblems 
with reduced spreading metric volume. Specifically, we 
present a divide-and-conquer strategy where the cost of 
a solution to a problem at a recursive level is C plus the 
cost of a solution to the subproblems at this level, and 
where the spreading metric volume on the subproblems 
is less than the original volume by (C= log n). This 
ensures that the resulting solution has cost O(log n) 
times the original spreading metric volume. 
We note that this is an existentially tight bound on 
the relationship between the spreading metric volume 
W and the true optimal values for these problems. 
For planar graphs, we combine a structural theorem 
of Klein, Plotkin, and Rao with our new recursion technique to show that the spreading metric cost volumes 
are within an O(log log n) factor of the cost of an optimal solution for the minimum linear arrangement, and 
the minimum containing interval graph problems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. 
Rogue is an architecture built on a real robot which provides algorithms for the integration of high-level planning, low-level robotic execution, and learning. Rogue addresses successfully several of the 
challenges of a dynamic office gopher environment. This article presents the techniques for the integration 
of planning and execution. 
Rogue uses and extends a classical planning algorithm to create plans for multiple interacting goals 
introduced by asynchronous user requests. Rogue translates the planner's actions to robot execution 
actions and monitors real world execution. Rogue is currently implemented using the prodigy4.0 
planner and the Xavier robot. This article describes how plans are created for multiple asynchronous goals, 
and how task priority and compatibility information is used to achieve appropriate efficient execution. We 
describe how Rogue communicates with the planner and the robot to interleave planning with execution 
so that the planner can replan for failed actions, identify the actual outcome of an action with multiple 
possible outcomes, and take opportunities from changes in the environment. 
Rogue represents a successful integration of a classical artificial intelligence planner with a real mobile 
robot.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently become a very popular facility for the dissemination of 
information. As a result of this popularity, it is experiencing rapidly increasing traffic load. Single 
machine servers cannot keep pace with the ever greater load being placed upon them. To alleviate this 
problem, we have implemented a distributed Web server group. The server group can effectively balance request load amongst its members (within about 10% of optimal), and client response time is no 
worse than in the single server case. Client response time was not improved because the measured client traffic consumed all available network throughput. The distributed operation of the server groups is 
completely transparent to standard Web clients.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Multimedia has generated widespread interest in real-time support within general purpose 
operating systems. Multimedia also places new demands on operating systems for interprocess 
communication. The Multimedia Testbed is a set of applications that stress consistent low-latency response and efficient interprocess communication for large blocks of data. The 
Multimedia Testbed was ported to Real-Time Mach in the hopes of providing predictable low-latency response and, consequently, good synchronization and low jitter as required for 
multimedia applications. Our work compares the performance of Real-Time Mach with that of 
Mach 3.0. Although the fixed-priority scheduling of Real-Time Mach is a substantial 
improvement, user threads are still preempted by device drivers, and the overall real-time 
performance is not suitable for multimedia applications. We discuss areas where Real-Time 
Mach needs improvement.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes an end-to-end method for extracting moving targets from a real-time video stream, 
classifying them into predefined categories according 
to image-based properties, and then robustly tracking 
them. Moving targets are detected using the pixelwise 
difference between consecutive image frames. A classi-ficatoin metric is applied these targets with a temporal 
consistency constraint to classify them into three categories: human, vehicle or background clutter. Once 
classified, targets are tracked by a combination of temporal differencing and template matching. 
The resulting system robustly identifies targets of 
interest, rejects background clutter, and continually 
tracks over large distances and periods of time despite 
occlusions, appearance changes and cessation of target 
motion.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Weak connectivity, in the form of intermittent, low-bandwidth, or expensive networks is a fact of life in mobile computing. 
In this paper, we describe how the Coda File System has evolved to exploit such networks. The underlying theme of this 
evolution has been the systematic introduction of adaptivity to eliminate hidden assumptions about strong connectivity. 
Many aspects of the system, including communication, cache validation, update propagation and cache miss handling have 
been modified. As a result, Coda is able to provide good performance even when network bandwidth varies over four orders 
of magnitude from modem speeds to LAN speeds.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. 
This paper presents an analysis of the following load balancing algorithm. At each step, each node in a network examines the number 
of tokens at each of its neighbors and sends a token to each neighbor with at least 2d + 1 fewer tokens, where d is the maximum degree 
of any node in the network. We show that within O(=ff) steps, the algorithm reduces the maximum difference in tokens between any 
two nodes to at most O((d 2 log n)=ff), where is the global imbalance in tokens (i.e., the maximum difference between the number of 
tokens at any node initially and the average number of tokens), n is the number of nodes in the network, and ff is the edge expansion of 
the network. The time bound is tight in the sense that for any graph with edge expansion ff, and for any value , there exists an initial 
distribution of tokens with imbalance for which the time to reduce the imbalance to even =2 is at least (=ff). The bound on the 
final imbalance is tight in the sense that there exists a class of networks that can be locally balanced everywhere (i.e., the maximum 
difference in tokens between any two neighbors is at most 2d), while the global imbalance remains ((d 2 log n)=ff). Furthermore, we show 
that upon reaching a state with a global imbalance of O((d 2 log n)=ff), the time for this algorithm to locally balance the network can be 
as large as (n 1=2 ). We extend our analysis to a variant of this algorithm for dynamic and asynchronous networks. We also present tight 
bounds for a randomized algorithm in which each node sends at most one token in each step.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes a media-independent, compositional, plan-based approach to representing attributive descriptions for use in integrated text and graphics generation. An attributive 
description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative 
goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience 
to identify a particular referent. This approach has been implemented as part of an architecture 
for generating integrated text and information graphics. Uses of referential and attributive descriptions are represented as two distinct types of communicative acts in a media-independent 
plan. It is particularly important to distinguish the two types of acts, since they have different 
consequences for dialogue and text generation, and for graphic design.  </abstract>

We describe a simple reduction from the problem of PAC-learning from multiple-instance examples to that of PAC-learning with one-sided random classification noise. Thus, all concept classes 
learnable with one-sided noise, which includes all concepts learnable in the usual 2-sided random 
noise model plus others such as the parity function, are learnable from multiple-instance examples. We also describe a more efficient (and somewhat technically more involved) reduction to 
the Statistical-Query model that results in a polynomial-time algorithm for learning axis-parallel 
rectangles with sample complexity ~ O(d 2 r=* 2 ), saving roughly a factor of r over the results of Auer 
et al. (1997).  </abstract>

described method allows not only for an efficient search through a decision space, but also for a concurrent validation 
of the learning algorithm performance on a given data. Potential usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated 
with the Fuzzy-ARTMAP neural network application to learning a qualitative positioning of an indoor mobile robot 
equipped with sonar range sensors. Automatically selected neural network setpoints reach a comparable performance 
to those achieved by human experts in relatively simple 2D cases. Migration of the proposed method to higher order 
optimization domains bears a big promise, but requires further research.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Physically-based modeling has been used in the past to support a variety of interactive modeling tasks including free-form surface design, mechanism design, constrained drawing, and interactive camera control. In these systems, the user interacts with the model 
by exerting virtual forces, to which the system responds subject 
to the active constraints. In the past, this kind of interaction has 
been applicable only to models that are governed by continuous 
parameters. In this paper we present an extension to mixed con-tinuous/discrete models, emphasizing constrained layout problems 
that arise in architecture and other domains. When the object being 
dragged is blocked from further motion by geometric constraints, a 
local discrete search is triggered, during which transformations such 
as swapping of adjacent objects may be performed. The result of the 
search is a nearby state in which the target object has been moved 
in the indicated direction and in which all constraints are satisfied. 
The transition to this state is portrayed using simple but effective animated visual effects. Following the transition, continuous dragging 
is resumed. The resulting seamless transitions between discrete and 
continuous manipulation allow the user to easily explore the mixed 
design space just by dragging objects. We demonstrate the method 
in application to architectural floor plan design, circuit board layout, 
art analysis, and page layout.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we show that application-aware adaptation, a 
collaborative partnership between the operating system and 
applications, offers the most general and effective approach 
to mobile information access. We describe the design of 
Odyssey, a prototype implementing this approach, and show 
how it supports concurrent execution of diverse mobile applications. We identify agility as a key attribute of adaptive systems, and describe how to quantify and measure it. 
We present the results of our evaluation of Odyssey, indicating performance improvements up to a factor of 5 on a 
benchmark of three applications concurrently using remote 
services over a network with highly variable bandwidth.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Increased reliance on agile manufacturing techniques has created a demand for systems to solve integrated process-planning 
and production-scheduling problems in large-scale dynamic environments. To be effective, these systems should provide user-oriented interactive functionality for managing the various user 
tasks and objectives and reacting to unexpected events. This paper describes the mixed-initiative problem-solving features of 
IP3S, an Integrated Process-Planning/Production-Scheduling 
shell for agile manufacturing. IP3S is a blackboard -based system 
that supports the concurrent development and dynamic revision 
of integrated process-planning and production-scheduling solutions and the maintenance of multiple problem instances and 
solutions, as well as other flexible user-oriented decision-making 
capabilities, allowing the user to control the scope of the problem and explore alternate tradeoffs (what-if scenarios) interactively. The system is scheduled for initial deployment 
and evaluation in a large and highly dynamic machine shop at 
Raytheon's Andover manufacturing facility.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper explores the feasibility of using lottery scheduling, a proportional-share resource management algorithm, 
to schedule processes under the FreeBSD operating system. 
Proportional-share scheduling enables flexible control over 
relative process execution rates and processor load insulation among groups of processes. We show that a straight implementation of lottery scheduling performs worse than the 
standard FreeBSD scheduler. This initial result prompted 
us to extend lottery scheduling. Except for one test we 
run, our resulting system performs within one percent of 
the FreeBSD scheduler. We describe our design, evaluate 
our implementation, and relate our experience in deploying 
our lottery scheduler on production machines.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Instrumental (or operant) conditioning, a form of animal learning, is similar to reinforcement learning 
(Watkins, 1989) in that it allows an agent to adapt its actions to gain maximally from the environment 
while only being rewarded for correct performance. But animals learn much more complicated behaviors 
through instrumental conditioning than robots presently acquire through reinforcement learning. We 
describe a new computational model of the conditioning process that attempts to capture some of the 
aspects that are missing from simple reinforcement learning: conditioned reinforcers, shifting reinforcement contingencies, explicit action sequencing, and state space refinement. We apply our model to a task 
commonly used to study working memory in rats and monkeys: the DMTS (Delayed Match to Sample) 
task. Animals learn this task in stages. In simulation, our model also acquires the task in stages, in a 
similar manner. We have used the model to train an RWI B21 robot.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
When documents are organized in a large 
number of topic categories, the categories 
are often arranged in a hierarchy. The U.S. 
patent database and Yahoo are two examples. 
This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive 
Bayes text classifier can be significantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of 
classes. We adopt an established statistical 
technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with 
its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique 
for smoothing n-grams in language modeling 
for speech recognition. 
Our method scales well to large data sets, 
with numerous categories in large hierarchies. 
Experimental results on three real-world data 
sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate web 
pages show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29% over the tradi 
tional flat classifier.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT: Functions of time are often used to represent continuous parameters and the passage 
of musical time (tempo). A new approach generalizes previous work in three ways. First, common 
temporal operations of stretching and shifting are special cases of a new general time-warping 
operation. Second, these operations are ``abstract.'' Instead of operating directly on signals or 
events, they operate on abstract behaviors that interpret the operations at an appropriate structural 
level. Third, time warping can be applied to both discrete events and continuous signals.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Digital interactive media augments interactive computing with video, audio, computer graphics and text, 
allowing multimedia presentations to be individually and dynamically tailored to the user. Multimedia, and 
particularly continuous media pose interesting problems for system designers, including those of latency 
and synchronization. These problems are especially evident when multimedia data is remote and must be 
accessed via networks. Latency and synchronization issues are discussed, and an integrated system, 
Tactus, is described. Tactus facilitates the implementation of interactive multimedia computer programs by 
managing latency and synchronization in the framework of an object-oriented graphical user interface 
toolkit.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Memory latency is an important bottleneck in system performance 
that cannot be adequately solved by hardware alone. Several promising software techniques have been shown to address this problem 
successfully in specific situations. However, the generality of these 
software approaches has been limited because current architectures 
do not provide a fine-grained, low-overhead mechanism for 
observing and reacting to memory behavior directly. To fill this 
need, we propose a new class of memory operations called informing memory operations, which essentially consist of a memory 
operation combined (either implicitly or explicitly) with a conditional branch-and-link operation that is taken only if the reference 
suffers a cache miss. We describe two different implementations of 
informing memory operationsone based on a cache-outcome 
condition code and another based on low-overhead trapsand find 
that modern in-order-issue and out-of-order-issue superscalar processors already contain the bulk of the necessary hardware support. 
We describe how a number of software-based memory optimizations can exploit informing memory operations to enhance performance, and look at cache coherence with fine-grained access 
control as a case study. Our performance results demonstrate that 
the runtime overhead of invoking the informing mechanism on the 
Alpha 21164 and MIPS R10000 processors is generally small 
enough to provide considerable exibility to hardware and software designers, and that the cache coherence application has 
improved performance compared to other current solutions. We 
believe that the inclusion of informing memory operations in 
future processors may spur even more innovative performance 
optimizations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. Neural-network methods are not commonly used for data-mining 
tasks, however, because they often produce incomprehensible models and require long training 
times. In this article, we describe neural-network learning algorithms that are able to produce 
comprehensible models, and that do not require excessive training times. Specifically, we discuss 
two classes of approaches for data mining with neural networks. The first type of approach, 
often called rule extraction, involves extracting symbolic models from trained neural networks. 
The second approach is to directly learn simple, easy-to-understand networks. We argue that, 
given the current state of the art, neural-network methods deserve a place in the tool boxes of 
data-mining specialists.  </abstract>

how these structures are used to solve the problems that plagued previous discourse planners, and allow a system to participate

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes an algorithm for simulating soft shadows at interactive rates using graphics hardware. On current graphics 
workstations, the technique can calculate the soft shadows cast by moving, complex objects onto multiple planar surfaces in 
about a second. In a static, diffuse scene, these high quality shadows can then be displayed at 30 Hz, independent of the number 
and size of the light sources. 
For a diffuse scene, the method precomputes a radiance texture that captures the shadows and other brightness variations on 
each polygon. The texture for each polygon is computed by creating registered projections of the scene onto the polygon from 
multiple sample points on each light source, and averaging the resulting hard shadow images to compute a soft shadow image. 
After this precomputation, soft shadows in a static scene can be displayed in real-time with simple texture mapping of the 
radiance textures. All pixel operations employed by the algorithm are supported in hardware by existing graphics workstations. 
The technique can be generalized for the simulation of shadows on specular surfaces.  </abstract>

<title> NIFDY: A Low Overhead, High Throughput Network Interface  </title>

<email> ftimothyc,sethgg@cs.berkeley.edu  </email>
<affiliation> Computer Science Division

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we present NIFDY, a network interface that uses admission control to reduce congestion and ensures that packets are 
received by a processor in the order in which they were sent, even 
if the underlying network delivers the packets out of order. The 
basic idea behind NIFDY is that each processor is allowed to have at 
most one outstanding packet to any other processor unless the destination processor has granted the sender the right to send multiple 
unacknowledged packets. Further, there is a low upper limit on the 
number of outstanding packets to all processors. 
We present results from simulations of a variety of networks 
(meshes, tori, butterflies, and fat trees) and traffic patterns to verify NIFDY's efficacy. Our simulations show that NIFDY increases 
throughput and decreases overhead. The utility of NIFDY increases 
as a network's bisection bandwidth decreases. When combined 
with the increased payload allowed by in-order delivery NIFDY increases total bandwidth delivered for all networks. The resources 
needed to implement NIFDY are small and constant with respect to 
network size.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
General media-processing programs are easily expressed with bit-addressing and variable-sized bit-fields. But the natural implementation of bit-addressing relies on dynamic shift offsets and repeated 
loads, resulting in slow execution. If the code is specialized to the 
alignment of the data against word boundaries, the offsets become 
static and many repeated loads can be removed. We show how introducing modular arithmetic into an automatic compiler generator 
enables the transformation of a program that uses bit-addressing 
into a synthesizer of fast specialized programs. 
In partial-evaluation jargon we say: modular arithmetic is supported by extending the binding time lattice used by the static analysis in a polyvariant compiler generator. The new binding time 
Cyclic functions like a partially static integer. 
A software cache combined with a fast, optimistic sharing analysis built into the compilers eliminates repeated loads and stores. 
The utility of the transformation is demonstrated with a collection 
of examples and benchmark data. The examples include vector 
arithmetic, audio synthesis, image processing, and a base-64 codec.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Inversion of multilayer synchronous networks is a method which tries to answer questions 
like "What kind of input will give a desired output?" or "Is it possible to get a desired 
output (under special input/output constraints)?". 
We will describe two methods of inverting a connectionist network. Firstly, we extend 
inversion via backpropagation (Linden/Kindermann [4], Williams [11]) to recurrent (El-man [1], Jordan [3], Mozer [5], Williams/Zipser [10]), time-delayed (Waibel at al. [9]) 
and discrete versions of continuous networks (Pineda [7], Pearlmutter [6]). The result 
of inversion is an input vector. The corresponding output vector is equal to the target 
vector except a small remainder. The knowledge of those attractors may help to understand the function and the generalization qualities of connectionist systems of this 
kind. 
Secondly, we introduce a new inversion method for proving the non-existence of an 
input combination under special constraints, e.g. in a subspace of the input space. This 
method works by iterative exclusion of invalid activation values. It might be a helpful 
way to judge the properties of a trained network. 
We conclude with simulation results of three different tasks: XOR, morse signal decoding 
and handwritten digit recognition.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe our impressions of the SUPRENUM project and of its primary 
supercomputer result, the Suprenum-1 prototype. We comment on the significance 
of the architecture, its role among contemporary systems and its relevance to 
current systems. We similarly discuss the SUPRENUM software and its impact on 
distributed systems. Finally we discuss the successes and failures observed 
throughout this exciting project and relate these to the organizational decisions on 
which SUPRENUM was based. 
As an illustration of Suprenum-1 capabilities, we describe the 
implementation of a fluid dynamical benchmark on the 256 node Suprenum-1 
parallel computer. The benchmark, the Shallow Water Equations, is frequently used 
as a model for both oceanographic and atmospheric circulation. We describe the

<abstract> Abstract 
Given a set of training examples, determining the appropriate number of free parameters is a challenging problem. Constructive 
learning algorithms attempt to solve this problem automatically by 
adding hidden units, and therefore free parameters, during learning. We explore an alternative class of algorithms|called metamorphosis algorithms|in which the number of units is fixed, but 
the number of free parameters gradually increases during learning. 
The architecture we investigate is composed of RBF units on a lattice, which imposes flexible constraints on the parameters of the 
network. Virtues of this approach include variable subset selection, robust parameter selection, multiresolution processing, and 
interpolation of sparse training data.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Sybil is a database integration and evolution environment for supporting large, heterogeneous applications. 
We are interested in using Sybil to support the data integration and evolution needs of applications that are using legacy databases and are looking to integrate with 
more modern database systems. The Sybil approach is 
based on loosely coupling databases or other persistent 
tools into lightweight alliances tailored for specific applications. Such alliances are built via four sorts of constructs: heterogeneous views, inter-database constraints, 
inter-database propagations, and integration supported 
by domain specific information.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Recent work in feature-based classification has focused on non-parametric techniques that can classify instances even when the underlying feature distributions are 
unknown. The inference algorithms for training these techniques, however, are designed 
to maximize the accuracy of the classifier, with all errors weighted equally. In many 
applications, certain errors are far more costly than others, and the need arises for 
non-parametric classification techniques that can be trained to optimize task-specific 
cost functions. This paper reviews the Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) algorithm for inducing multivariate decision trees, and shows how LMDT can be altered to 
induce decision trees that minimize arbitrary misclassification cost functions (MCFs). 
Demonstrations of pixel classification in outdoor scenes show how MCFs can optimize 
the performance of embedded classifiers within the context of larger image understand 
ing systems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Neural networks are trained for balancing 1 
and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed 
track. For one variant of the single pole system, only pole angle and cart position variables are supplied as inputs; the network 
must learn to compute velocities. All of the 
problems are solved using a fixed architecture 
and using a new version of cellular encoding that evolves an application specific architecture with real-valued weights. The learning times and generalization capabilities are 
compared for neural networks developed using both methods. After a post processing 
simplification, topologies produced by cellular encoding were very simple and could be 
analyzed. Architectures with no hidden units 
were produced for the single pole and the two 
pole problem when velocity information is 
supplied as an input. Moreover, these linear 
solutions display good generalization. For all 
the control problems, cellular encoding can 
automatically generate architectures whose 
complexity and structure reflect the features 
of the problem to solve.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Template matching is an effective means of locating vehicles in outdoor scenes, but it tends to be 
a computationally expensive. To reduce processing time, we use large neural networks to predict, or 
index, a small subset of templates that are likely to match each window in an image. Results on actual 
LADAR range images show that limiting the templates to those selected by the neural networks reduces 
the computation time by a factor of 5 without sacrificing the accuracy of the results.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We have studied the performance of a high-speed 
commercial spread-spectrum wireless LAN that uses the 
CSMA/CA multiple-access strategy. Employing synthetic workloads, we measured packet capture success 
more so than signal propagation characteristics. Specifically, we measured throughput, packet loss rates, range, 
and patterns of errors within packets. We conclude 
that CSMA/CA is quite successful in allocating bandwidth under stress, but that packet capture rate degrades very quickly once the LAN's effective range is 
exceeded. Hence, network maintainers should plan the 
layout of wireless networks at least as carefully as they 
plan wired networks.  </abstract>

3rd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems.)  </note>
<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, we present new algorithms to balance 
the computation of parallel hash joins over heterogeneous processors in the presence of data skew and external loads. Heterogeneity in our model consists of 
disparate computing elements, as well as general purpose computing ensembles that are subject to external loading (e.g., a LAN connected workstation cluster). Data skew manifests itself as significant non-uniformities in the distribution of attribute values of 
underlying relations that are involved in a join. 
We develop cost models and predictive dynamic 
load balancing protocols to detect imbalance during 
the computation of a single large join. New predictive bucket scheduling algorithms are presented that 
smooth out the load over the entire ensemble by reallocating buckets whenever imbalance is detected. Our 
algorithms can account for imbalance due to data skew 
as well as heterogeneity in the computing environment. 
Significant performance gains are reported for a wide 
range of test cases on a prototype implementation of 
the system.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we discuss a data mining framework for constructing intrusion detection models. 
The key ideas are to mine system audit data for consistent and useful patterns of program and 
user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features presented in the patterns to compute 
(inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Our past experiments showed that classifiers can be used to detect intrusions, provided that sufficient audit 
data is available for training and the right set of system features are selected. We propose to use 
the association rules and frequent episodes computed from audit data as the basis for guiding the 
audit data gathering and feature selection processes. We modify these two basic algorithms to use 
axis attribute(s) as a form of item constraints to compute only the relevant (useful) patterns, and 
an iterative level-wise approximate mining procedure to uncover the low frequency (but important) 
patterns. We report our experiments in using these algorithms on real-world audit data.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we study the issue of how to scale machine learning algorithms, that 
typically are designed to deal with main-memory based datasets, to efficiently learn 
models from large distributed databases. We have explored an approach called meta-learning that is related to the traditional approaches of data reduction commonly 
employed in distributed database query processing systems. We explore the scalability 
of learning arbiter and combiner trees from partitioned data. Arbiter and combiner 
trees integrate classifiers trained in parallel from small disjoint subsets. Previous work 
demonstrated the efficacy of these meta-learning architectures in terms of accuracy 
of the computed meta-classifiers. Here we discuss the computational performance 
of constructing arbiter and combiner trees in terms of speedup and scalability as a 
function of database size and number of partitions. The performance of serial learning 
algorithms is evaluated. We then analyze the performance of the algorithms used to 
construct combiner and arbiter trees in parallel. Our empirical results validate these 
analyses and indicate that the techniques can effectively scale up to large datasets with 
millions of records using cheap commodity hardware.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. This paper presents Kenmore, a general framework for knowledge acquisition for natural language processing (NLP) systems. To ease 
the acquisition of knowledge in new domains, Kenmore exploits an online corpus using robust sentence analysis and embedded symbolic machine learning techniques while requiring only minimal human intervention. By treating all problems in ambiguity resolution as classification 
tasks, the framework uniformly addresses a range of subproblems in sentence analysis, each of which traditionally had required a separate computational mechanism. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the 
successful use of Kenmore for learning solutions to several problems in 
lexical and structural ambiguity resolution. We argue that the learning 
and knowledge acquisition components should be embedded components 
of the NLP system in that (1) learning should take place within the 
larger natural language understanding system as it processes text, and 
(2) the learning components should be evaluated in the context of prac 
tical language-processing tasks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Many high-level language compilers generate C code and 
then invoke a C compiler for code generation. To date, most 
of these compilers link the resulting code against a conservative mark-sweep garbage collector in order to reclaim unused 
memory. We introduce a new collector, MCC, based on an 
extension of mostly-copying collection. 
We analyze the various design decisions made in MCC 
and provide a performance comparison to the most widely 
used conservative mark-sweep collector (the Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector). Our results show that a good mostly-copying collector can outperform a mature highly-optimized 
mark-sweep collector when physical memory is large relative 
to the live data. A surprising result of our analysis is that 
cache behavior can have a greater impact on overall performance than either collector time, or allocation code.  </abstract>

<title> On-Line Search in a Simple Polygon  </title>
<author> Jon M. Kleinberg   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We consider a number of search and exploration problems, from the perspective of 
robot navigation in a simple polygon. These problems are "on-line" in the sense that 
the robot does not have access to the map of the polygon; it must make decisions as it 
proceeds, based only on what it has seen so far. For the problem of exploring a simple 
rectilinear polygon (under the L 1 norm), Deng, Kameda, and Papadimitriou give a 
2-competitive deterministic algorithm; we present a randomized exploration algorithm 
which is 5=4-competitive. Using similar techniques, we are able to give an algorithm 
for searching an arbitrary, unknown rectilinear polygon. No constant competitive ratio 
is attainable in this case, but our algorithm is within a constant factor of optimal in 
the worst case; in a sense, it is a generalization of some of the strategies of Baeza-Yates, Culberson, and Rawlins to a much more general class of search spaces. Finally, 
we examine a type of polygon for which competitive search is possible | the class of 
"streets" considered by Klein, who gave a 1 + 3 
2 -competitive algorithm for the search 
problem in this case. We present a simple algorithm with a competitive ratio of at 
most 
q 
p 
8 (~ 2:61); in rectilinear streets it achieves the optimal competitive ratio 
of 
2.  </abstract>

whether a goal or failure region has been achieved. Based on these methods and 
strategies for visually-cued camera control, we have built a robot surveillance 
system in which one mobile robot navigates to a viewing position from which 
it has an unobstructed view of a goal region, and then uses visual recognition 
to detect when a specific target has entered the region.  </abstract>

Recently, several new algorithms have been developed for the minimum cut problem. 
These algorithms are very different from the earlier ones and from each other and substantially improve worst-case time bounds for the problem. We conduct experimental evaluation 
the relative performance of these algorithms. In the process, we develop heuristics and data 
structures that substantially improve practical performance of the algorithms. We also develop problem families for testing minimum cut algorithms. Our work leads to a better 
understanding of practical performance of the minimum cut algorithms and produces very 
efficient codes for the problem.  </abstract>

<title> Performing Out-of-Core FFTs on Parallel Disk Systems  </title>
<author> Thomas H. Cormen  
David M. Nicol   </author>
<affiliation> Dartmouth College 
Department of Computer Science  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) plays a key role in many areas of computational science 
and engineering. Although most one-dimensional FFT problems can be entirely solved entirely in 
main memory, some important classes of applications require out-of-core techniques. For these, 
use of parallel I/O systems can improve performance considerably. This paper shows how to 
perform one-dimensional FFTs using a parallel disk system with independent disk accesses. We 
present both analytical and experimental results for performing out-of-core FFTs in two ways: 
using traditional virtual memory with demand paging, and using a provably asymptotically 
optimal algorithm for the Parallel Disk Model (PDM) of Vitter and Shriver. When run on a 
DEC 2100 server with a large memory and eight parallel disks, the optimal algorithm for the 
PDM runs up to 144.7 times faster than in-core methods under demand paging. Moreover, even 
including I/O costs, the normalized times for the optimal PDM algorithm are competitive, or 
better than, those for in-core methods even when they run entirely in memory.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Agent Tcl is a transportable agent system. The agents are written in an extended version of the 
Tool Command Lanuage (Tcl). Each agent can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport 
to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. This migration is accomplished with 
the agent jump command. agent jump captures the current state of the Tcl script and transfers this 
state to the destination machine. The state is restored on the new machine and the Tcl script continues 
its execution from the command immediately after the agent jump. In addition to migration, agents 
can send messages to each other and can establish direct connections. A direct connection is more 
efficient than message passing for bulk data transfer. Finally, agents can use the Tk toolkit to create 
graphical user interfaces on their current machine. Agent Tcl is implemented as two components. The 
first component is an extended Tcl interpreter. The second component is a server which runs on each 
machine. The server accepts incoming agents, messages and connection requests and keeps track of the 
agents that are running on its machine. An alpha release of Agent Tcl is available for public use. This 
documentation describes how to obtain and compile the source code, how to run the server and how to 
write transportable agents.  </abstract>

Given a set of n points, what is the description complexity of their convex hull? In our world, this question 
is understood with an implicit "in the worst case", and the answer is n bd=2c where d is the dimension of 
the underlying space. This is not entirely satisfactory, as this description complexity can vary tremendously 
depending on the positions of the points. Another approach is to look at the expected description complexity 
when the points are drawn from a given distribution. This type of analysis, initiated by Renyi and Sulanke 
[RS63] and pursued by others gets its value from the fact that this expectation is in general much smaller 
than in the worst case, and, more importantly, in that it often allows one to design algorithms that have 
expected running times against which worst case aware algorithms cannot compete. For instance, the convex 
hull of n points drawn independently uniformly at random from a d-dimensional hypercube has expected 
complexity O(log d1 n), and can be computed in expected linear time. 
In parallel, in the past decade, a number of papers have considered a setting where points are allowed 
to move along low degree algebraic trajectories. Different questions have been asked in this context. In 
particular, Atallah [Ata85], studied the number of times the combinatorial description of the convex hull 
or closest pair can change, in the worst case ("dynamic computational geometry"). More recently, Basch, 
Guibas, and Hershberger [BGH97] have designed kinetic data structures to maintain these attributes in an 
online setting, measuring the quality of a kinetic data structure by the ratio of the worst case number of 
changes to the configuration of interest, to the worst case number of changes to the data structure itself, for 
low degree algebraic motions. However, an experimental study undertaken in [BGSZ97] to assess the quality 
of these data structures in practice shows that the worst case analysis can hide vastly different results in 
terms of expectation when the point positions and speeds are drawn at random from some distributions. It 
is this study that motivated the present paper. 
In this communication, we report several results on the expected number of changes to various combinatorial structures for the case when points are drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit square. These 
results can be generalized for any dimension d &gt; 2.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The geometric point set matching problem in 2 and 3 dimensions is a well-studied problem with application to areas such as computer vision and pattern recognition, computational chemistry and other fields 
such as cartography and computer animation. The basic problems can be formulated as follows. Given 
some choice of a space of transformations and a similarity measure d(P; Q) for two point sets P and Q in 
Euclidean space. 
Problem 1 (Pattern Matching (PM)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = k and jQj = n with 
k n, and an * &gt; 0, find a transformation T for which d(T (P ); Q) * or return none if no such T exists. 
Problem 2 (Largest Common Point-set (LCP)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = m and jQj = 
n, K &gt; 0 and * &gt; 0, find a transformation T and a set P 0 P of size jP 0 j K such that jd(T (P 0 ); Q)j * 
or return none if no such T and P 0 exist. 
We restrict T to the space of rigid Euclidean translations and rotations. The similarity measures of interest 
to us are: the exact metric 1 d E (P; Q) (binary-valued, requiring each point in P to be mapped to a point in 
Q); the Hausdorff metric d H (P; Q) (maximum over all points in P of the distance to the nearest point in 
Q); and, the matching metric d M (bottleneck matching distance). 
A detailed study of this set of problems was initiated by Alt, Mehlhorn, Wagener, and Welzl [AMWW88]. 
In this seminal work, they propose a suite of algorithms for the exact and matching metrics. More recent work 
led to improved bounds for pattern matching and LCP under the exact metric. The problem of estimating 
the minimum Hausdorff distance between two point sets in 2 and 3 dimensions has been studied extensively. 
Clearly, any real application of such algorithms has to deal with the presence of noise in data, requiring 
the algorithms to perform matching within the limits of some reasonable noise model. In fact, our interest 
in these problems arose during an attempt to implement such algorithms for applications in computer vision 
and in computational biology and chemistry, particularly rational drug design [FKL + 97]. We discovered that 
noise present in real data rendered most known algorithms inoperative. In hindsight, this is not surprising 
for, as noted in the survey by Alt and Guibas [AG96], these algorithms are likely to be "difficult to implement 
and numerically unstable due to the necessary computation of intersections of complex algebraic surfaces." 
Worse still, they have unacceptably high running times: for example, even in R 2 , LCP under the matching 
metric requires O(n 8 ) time, although under additional restrictions on noise regions the running times can be  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Classification is a key function of many "business 
intelligence" toolkits and a fundamental building block 
in data mining. Immense data may be needed to train 
a classifier for good accuracy. The state-of-art classifiers [21, 25] need an in-memory data structure of 
size O(N ), where N is the size of the training data, 
to achieve efficiency. For large data sets, such a data 
structure will not fit in the internal memory. The best 
previously known classifier does a quadratic number of 
I/Os for large N . 
In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm (classifier) called MIND (MINing in 
Databases). MIND can be phrased in such a way that 
its implementation is very easy using the extended relational calculus SQL, and this in turn allows the classifier to be built into a relational database system directly. MIND is truly scalable with respect to I/O efficiency, which is important since scalability is a key 
requirement for any data mining algorithm. 
We built a prototype of MIND in the relational 
database manager DB2 and benchmarked its performance. We describe the working prototype and report 
the measured performance with respect to the previous 
method of choice. MIND scales not only with the size 
of the datasets but also with the number of processors 
on an IBM SP2 computer system. Even on uniproces-sors, MIND scales well beyond the dataset sizes previously published for classifiers. We also give some 
insights that may have an impact on the evolution of 
the extended relational calculus SQL.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Reinforcement learning is the problem of generating optimal behavior in a sequential decision-making environment given the opportunity of 
interacting with it. Many algorithms for solving reinforcement-learning 
problems work by computing improved estimates of the optimal value 
function. We extend prior analyses of reinforcement-learning algorithms 
and present a powerful new theorem that can provide a unified analysis of 
value-function-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. The usefulness 
of the theorem lies in how it allows the asynchronous convergence of a 
complex reinforcement-learning algorithm to be proven by verifying that 
a simpler synchronous algorithm converges. We illustrate the application 
of the theorem by analyzing the convergence of Q-learning, model-based 
reinforcement learning, Q-learning with multi-state updates, Q-learning 
for Markov games, and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.  </abstract>

<title> Representing Moving Images with Layers  </title>
<author> John Y. A. Wang AND Edward H. Adelson  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We describe a system for representing moving 
images with sets of overlapping layers. Each 
layer contains an intensity map that defines the 
additive values of each pixel, along with an alpha 
map that serves as a mask indicating the transparency. The layers are ordered in depth and 
they occlude each other in accord with the rules 
of compositing. Velocity maps define how the 
layers are to be warped over time. The layered 
representation is more flexible than standard image transforms and can capture many important 
properties of natural image sequences. We describe some methods for decomposing image sequences into layers using motion analysis, and we 
discuss how the representation may be used for 
image coding and other applications.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A revolution is occurring in the scope and range 
of information, communication and education services 
that will be made available to schools, libraries, town-halls, clinics and, most importantly, residences. These 
services will be provided initially, primarily over hybrid fiber-cable systems, either by telephone companies 
or cable companies. The old cable plant is being upgraded and used in totally new ways. 
The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient 
channel access. We present a media access protocol 
that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the 
protocol resident in the station as simple as possible. 
Thus we use centralized control located in the cable 
head-end and minimize intelligence in the station. We 
refer to this protocol as Centralized Priority Reservation or CPR. A station wishing to transmit sends a request to the head-end using a contention channel. The 
head-end acknowledges the request and then schedules 
the request, informing the station by means of a grant 
message when to transmit. 
The protocol performs well under heavy load. Performance is affected little by the number of stations, 
the speed of the system and the physical length of the 
system.  </abstract>

has progressed, largely independently, in two separate camps: the largely academic high performance 
Parallel And Distributed (discrete event) Simulation (PADS) community, and the DoD-centered Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) community. 
This tutorial gives an overview and comparison of 
work in these two areas, emphasizing issues related to 
distributed execution where these fields have the most 
overlap. Differences in the fundamental assumptions

<title> Storage Systems for Movies-on-Demand Video Servers  </title>
<author> Ann L. Chervenak  </author>
<date> April 7, 1995  </date>
<abstract> 1 Abstract 
In this paper, we evaluate storage system alternatives for movies-on-demand video servers. We begin by 
characterizing the movies-on-demand workload. Then we study disk farms in which one movie is stored per 
disk. This is a simple scheme, but it wastes substantial disk bandwidth, since disks holding less popular 
movies are under-utilized; also, good performance requires that movies be replicated to reflect the user 
request pattern. Next, we examine disk farms in which movies are striped across disks, and find that 
striped video servers offer close to full utilization of the disks by achieving better load balancing. Finally, we 
evaluate the use of storage hierarchies for video service that include a tertiary library along with a disk farm. 
Unfortunately, we show that the performance of neither magnetic tape libraries nor optical disk jukeboxes 
as part of a storage hierarchy is adequate to service the predicted distribution of movie accesses. We suggest 
changes to tertiary libraries that would make them better-suited to these applications.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract| Generalized connectors provide the capability to connect a single input to one or more outputs. Such networks play an important role in supporting any application that involves the distribution of information from one source to many destinations or many sources to many destinations. We present the first analytic model for evaluating blocking probability in generalized connectors. The model allows flexibility in specifying traffic fanout characteristics and network routing algorithms. Equations are derived for computing blocking probability for the important class of series-parallel networks. We investigate the accuracy of the equations by comparing the blocking probability computed using the equations to results from simulation.  </abstract>

the CASE tool's support for drawing, linking, and modifying pictorial 
notations for program design in order to make it easier to construct a

<abstract> Abstract 
Association rules, introduced by Agrawal, Imielinski, and 
Swami, are rules of the form "for 90 % of the rows of the 
relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W , 
then it has 1 also in column B". Efficient methods exist for 
discovering association rules from large collections of data. 
The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large 
that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from 
it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple 
formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization 
tool interfaces with rule templates.  </abstract>

We describe a database system for writing, editing, and querying structured documents. The structure of text is described using a context-free 
grammar. The operations are implemented using a powerful query language. The system supports the use of user-defined multiple views of the 
documents: one view can contain all the structure explicitly, while another 
can contain only part of the document and have only part of the structure visible. This makes the system flexible for different editing tasks. 
The system is implemented in C using a relational database system.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. The core of multiple-view geometry is governed by the fundamental matrix and the trilinear 
tensor. In this paper we unify both representations by first re-deriving the fundamental matrix as a rank 
deficient tensor, and secondly by deriving a unified set of operators that are transparent to the number of 
views. As a result, we show that the basic building block of the geometry of multiple views is the trilinear 
tensor of three views and that this tensor specializes to the fundamental matrix (in it's tensor form) in 
the case of two views. The properties of the tensor (geometric interpretation, contraction properties, 
etc.) are independent of the number of views (two or three). As a byproduct, every two-view algorithm 
can be considered as a degenerate three-view algorithm and three-view algorithms can work with either 
two or three images, all using one standard set of tensor operations. To highlight the usefulness of this 
paradigm we provide two practical applications. First we present a novel view synthesis algorithm that 
starts with the fundamental matrix (in its tensor form) and seamlessly move to the general trilinear 
tensor, all using one set of tensor operations. The second application is a camera stabilization algorithm, 
originally introduced for three views, now working with two views without modification.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
When a moldable job is submitted to a space-sharing 
parallel computer, it must choose whether to begin execution on a small, available cluster or wait in queue for 
more processors to become available. To make this decision, it must predict how long it will have to wait for 
the larger cluster. We propose statistical techniques for 
predicting these queue times, and develop an allocation 
strategy that uses these predictions. We present a workload model based on observed workloads at the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center and the Cornell Theory Center, 
and use this model to drive simulations of various allocation strategies. We find that prediction-based allocation 
not only improves the turnaround time of individual jobs; 
it also improves the utilization of the system as a whole.  </abstract>

<title> Coordination and Control Structures and Processes: 
Possibilities for Connectionist Networks (CN)  </title>
<author> Vasant Honavar & Leonard Uhr  </author>
<affiliation> Computer Sciences Department 
University of Wisconsin-Madison  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
The absence of powerful control structures and processes that synchronize, coordinate, switch between, choose among, regulate, direct, modulate interactions between, and 
combine distinct yet interdependent modules of large connectionist networks (CN) is 
probably one of the most important reasons why such networks have not yet succeeded at 
handling difficult tasks (e.g. complex object recognition and description, complex 
problem-solving, planning). 
In this paper we examine how CN built from large numbers of relatively simple 
neuron-like units can be given the ability to handle problems that in typical multi-computer networks and artificial intelligence programs along with all other types of 
programs are always handled using extremely elaborate and precisely worked out central control (coordination, synchronization, switching, etc.). We point out the several 
mechanisms for central control of this un-brain-like sort that CN already have built into 
them albeit in hidden, often overlooked, ways. 
We examine the kinds of control mechanisms found in computers, programs, fetal 
development, cellular function and the immune system, evolution, social organizations, 
and especially brains, that might be of use in CN. Particularly intriguing suggestions are 
found in the pacemakers, oscillators, and other local sources of the brain's complex partial synchronies; the diffuse, global effects of slow electrical waves and neurohormones; 
the developmental program that guides fetal development; communication and coordination within and among living cells; the working of the immune system; the evolutionary 
processes that operate on large populations of organisms; and the great variety of partially competing partially cooperating controls found in small groups, organizations, and 
larger societies. All these systems are rich in control but typically control that emerges 
from complex interactions of many local and diffuse sources. We explore how several 
different kinds of plausible control mechanisms might be incorporated into CN, and 
assess their potential benefits with respect to their cost.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems require selection of a 
subset of attributes or features (from a much larger set) to represent the patterns to be classified. 
This is due to the fact that the performance of the classifier (usually induced by some learning 
algorithm) and the cost of classification are sensitive to the choice of the features used to construct 
the classifier. Exhaustive evaluation of possible feature subsets is usually infeasible in practice because 
of the large amount of computational effort required. Genetic algorithms, which belong to a class of 
randomized heuristic search techniques, offer an attractive approach to find near-optimal solutions 
to such optimization problems. This paper presents an approach to feature subset selection using a 
genetic algorithm. Some advantages of this approach include the ability to accommodate multiple 
criteria such as accuracy and cost of classification into the feature selection process and to find feature 
subsets that perform well for particular choices of the inductive learning algorithm used to construct 
the pattern classifier. Our experiments with several benchmark real-world pattern classification 
problems demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to feature subset selection in the automated 
design of neural networks for pattern classification and knowledge discovery.  </abstract>

similar situations were previously explained, and selection of the candidate to accept is based on its 
likelihood, without considering the information needs beyond routine understanding. Problems arise 
when applying these methods to everyday understanding: The vast range of possible explanations 
makes it difficult to control the cost of explanation construction and to assure that the explanations 
generated will actually be useful. 
We argue that these problems can be overcome by using goals and experience to guide both 
explanation generation and evaluation. Our work is within the framework of case-based explanation, which builds explanations by retrieving and adapting prior explanations stored in memory. 
We substantiate our model by describing mechanisms that enable it to effectively generate good 
explanations. First, we demonstrate that there exists a theory of anomaly and explanation that can 
guide retrieval of relevant explanations. Second, we present a plausibility evaluation process that 
efficiently detects conflicts and confirmations of an explanation's assumptions by prior patterns, 
making it possible to focus explanation adaptation when retrieved explanations are implausible. 
Third, we present methods for judging whether explanations provide the information needed to satisfy explainer goals beyond routine understanding. By reflecting experience and goals in the search 
for explanations, case-based explanation provides a practical mechanism for guiding search towards 
explanations that are both plausible and useful.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The case-based reasoning process depends on 
multiple overlapping knowledge sources, each 
of which provides an opportunity for learning. Exploiting these opportunities requires 
not only determining the learning mechanisms 
to use for each individual knowledge source, 
but also how the different learning mechanisms interact and their combined utility. This 
paper presents a case study examining the 
relative contributions and costs involved in 
learning processes for three different knowledge sources|cases, case adaptation knowledge, and similarity information|in a case-based planner. It demonstrates the importance 
of interactions between different learning processes and identifies a promising method for integrating multiple learning methods to improve 
case-based reasoning.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Several ways of improving the realism of the results 
of traditional ray tracing are presented. The essential physical quantities of spectral radiant power and 
spectral radiance and their use in lighting calculations 
are discussed. Global illumination terms are derived 
by employing illumination ray tracing for calculation of 
quickly changing indirect lighting components, and ra-diosity ray tracing for slowly changing indirect lighting 
components. Direct lighting is calculated during the 
viewing phase allowing the use of bump maps. Finally, 
a method is introduced that reduces the total number 
of shadow rays to no more than the total number of 
viewing rays for a given picture.  </abstract>

<address> Baltimore, MD 21218  </address>
<abstract> ABSTRACT 
We present a novel robust methodology for corresponding a dense set of points on an 
object surface from photometric values, for 3-D stereo computation of depth. The methodology utilizes multiple stereo pairs of images, each stereo pair taken of exactly the same 
scene but under different illumination. With just 2 stereo pairs of images taken respectively for 2 different illumination conditions, a stereo pair of ratio images can be produced; one for the ratio of left images, and one for the ratio of right images. We 
demonstrate how the photometric ratios composing these images can be used for accurate 
correspondence of object points. Object points having the same photometric ratio with 
respect to 2 different illumination conditions comprise a well-defined equivalence class of 
physical constraints defined by local surface orientation relative to illumination conditions. We formally show that for diffuse reection the photometric ratio is invariant to 
varying camera characteristics, surface albedo, and viewpoint and that therefore the same 
photometric ratio in both images of a stereo pair implies the same equivalence class of 
physical constraints. Corresponding photometric ratios along epipolar lines in a stereo pair 
of images under different illumination conditions is therefore a robust correspondence of 
equivalent physical constraints, and determination of depth from stereo can be performed 
without explicitly knowing what these physical constraints being corresponded actually 
are. This implies a very practical shape-from-stereo methodology applicable to perspective views and not requiring any knowledge whatsoever of illumination conditions. This is 
particularly practical for determination of 3-D shape on smooth featureless surfaces which 
has previously been hard to perform using stereo. We demonstrate experimental 3-D shape 
determination from a dense set of points using our stereo technique on smooth objects of 
known ground truth shape that are accurate to well within 1% depth accuracy.  </abstract>

<title> Best-Case Results for Nearest Neighbor 
Learning  </title>
<author> Steven Salzberg, Arthur Delcher, David Heath, and Simon Kasif  </author>
<abstract> Abstract| In this paper we propose a theoretical model 
for analysis of classification methods, in which the teacher 
knows the classification algorithm and chooses examples in 
the best way possible. We apply this model using the nearest-neighbor learning algorithm, and develop upper and lower 
bounds on sample complexity for several different concept 
classes. For some concept classes, the sample complexity 
turns out to be exponential even using this best-case model, 
which implies that the concept class is inherently difficult 
for the nearest-neighbor algorithm. We identify several geometric properties that make learning certain concepts relatively easy. Finally we discuss the relation of our work 
to helpful teacher models, its application to decision-tree 
learning algorithms, and some of its implications for current experimental work.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A distinct advantage of symbolic learning 
algorithms over artificial neural networks is 
that typically the concept representations 
they form are more easily understood by humans. One approach to understanding the 
representations formed by neural networks is 
to extract symbolic rules from trained networks. In this paper we describe and investigate an approach for extracting rules from 
networks that uses (1) the NofM extraction algorithm, and (2) the network training 
method of soft weight-sharing. Previously, 
the NofM algorithm had been successfully 
applied only to knowledge-based neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that 
our extracted rules generalize better than 
rules learned using the C4.5 system. In addition to being accurate, our extracted rules 
are also reasonably comprehensible.  </abstract>

<abstract> We report on work done to develop a benchmark problem for genetic programming, both

This benchmark, the royal tree, is a function that accounts for tree shape as part of its 
evaluation function, thus it controls for a parameter not often found in the GP literature. 
It also is a progressive function, allowing the user to set the difficulty of the problem 
attempted. We not only describe the function, but also report on results of using island 
parallelism for solving GP problems. The results obtained are somewhat surprising, as it 
appears that a single large population outperforms a group of smaller populations under 
all the conditions tested.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint 
Logic). In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false 
for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems, 
examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a 
clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where 
each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning 
techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal 
form. 
We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems, 
and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical 
approaches.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, followed by automated segmentation of the corpus callosum 
(CC) in midsagittal sections have important applications 
in both clinical neurology and neurocognitive research 
since the size and shape of the CC are shown to be correlated to sex, age, neurodegenerative diseases and various lateralized behavior in man. Moreover, whole head, 
multispectral 3D MRI recordings enable voxel-based tissue classification and estimation of total brain volumes, 
in addition to CC morphometric parameters. We propose 
a new algorithm that uses both multispectral MRI measurements (intensity values) and prior information about 
shape (CC template) to segment CC in midsagittal slices 
with very little user interaction. The algorithm has been 
tested on a sample of 10 subjects scanned with multispec-tral 3D MRI, collected for a study of dyslexia, with very 
good agreement between the manually traced (true) CC 
outline and the detected CC outline. We conclude that 
the proposed method for CC segmentation is promising for 
clinical use when multispectral MR images are recorded.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents a study of the statistical characteristics and multiplexing of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) 
MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on 
23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment 
movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup 
which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the 
video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), 
it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated 
forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected 
by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in 
which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The 
number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Since the late eighties, much progress has been made in the theory of termination analysis for 
logic programs. However, from a practical point of view, the significance of much of the work 
on termination is hard to judge, since experimental evaluations rarely get published. Here we 
describe and evaluate a termination analyzer for Mercury, a strongly typed and moded logic- 
functional programming language. Mercury's high degree of referential transparency and the 
guaranteed availability of reliable mode information simplify the termination analysis of Mer- 
cury compared with that of other logic programming languages. We describe our termination 
analyzer, which uses a variant of a method developed by Plumer. It deals with full Mercury, 
including modules, declarative input/output, the foreign language interface, and higher-order 
features. In spite of these obstacles, it produces high-quality termination information, comparable to the results recently obtained by Lindenstrauss and Sagiv. Most important, in stark 
contrast with Lindenstrauss and Sagiv's experimental results, our analyzer has a negligible 
impact on the running time of the compiler of which it is part, even for large programs. This 
means that the Mercury compiler can produce valuable termination information at no real 
cost to the programmer.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In comparision with other games, particularly chess, the research in computer bridge is 
immature, and the best bridge-playing programs are mediocre. We propose to study the 
automation of the card-playing segment of bridge (omitting bidding), using a number of 
different techniques. In this paper we first give an introduction to the state of computer 
bridge. Next, we propose two possible architectures for solving double-dummy bridge 
(i.e., a simplified bridge game with perfect information): The first is based on the 
combination of And-OR search and heuristic evaluation. The second forms a global plan 
by merging subplans for each individual suit. Next, to deal with uncertain information in 
real bridge, we present a new mechanism that combines the concepts of both minimax 
search and possible worlds. Finally we give a brief description of further work toward 
automating card-playing in real bridge.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning 
(EBRL) was introduced by Dietterich and 
Flann as a way of combining the ability of 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn optimal plans with the generalization ability 
of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) (Di-etterich & Flann, 1995). We extend this 
work to domains where the agent must order and achieve a sequence of subgoals in 
an optimal fashion. Hierarchical EBRL can 
effectively learn optimal policies in some of 
these sequential task domains even when the 
subgoals weakly interact with each other. 
We also show that when a planner that can 
achieve the individual subgoals is available, 
our method converges even faster.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
This paper describes and evaluates distributed 
wavelength reservation protocols for all-optical WDM 
networks. These protocols are essential for applying 
WDM techniques to large scale all-optical networks. 
The protocols ensure that the wavelengths on the links 
along a path are reserved before communication takes 
place. A message is transmitted using the reserved 
wavelengths and remains in the optical domain utill 
it reaches the destination. Based upon the timing at 
which the reservation is performed, the protocols are 
classified into two categories: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Although 
forward reservation protocols are simpler, our performance study shows that backward reservation protocols provide better performance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A key question in conditional planning is: how many, 
and which of the possible execution failures should be 
planned for? One cannot, in general, plan for all the 
possible failures because the search space is too large. 
One cannot ignore all the possible failures, or one will 
fail to produce sufficiently flexible plans. In this paper, 
we describe an approach to conditional planning that 
attempts to identify the contingencies that contribute 
the most to a plan's overall utility. Plan generation 
proceeds by handling the most important contingencies first, extending the plan to include actions that 
will be taken in case the contingency fails. We discuss 
the representational issues that must be addressed in 
order to implement such an algorithm, and present an 
example which illustrates our approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The distribution of resources among processors, memory and 
caches is a crucial question faced by designers of large-scale 
parallel machines. If a machine is to solve problems with a 
certain data set size, should it be built with a large number of 
processors each with a small amount of memory, or a smaller 
number of processors each with a large amount of memory? 
How much cache memory should be provided per processor for 
cost-effectiveness? And how do these decisions change as larger 
problems are run on larger machines? 
In this paper, we explore the above questions based on the 
characteristics of five important classes of large-scale parallel scientific applications. We first show that all the applications have a hierarchy of well-defined per-processor working 
sets, whose size, performance impact and scaling characteristics 
can help determine how large different levels of a multiprocessor's cache hierarchy should be. Then, we use these working sets together with certain other important characteristics of 
the applications|such as communication to computation ratios, 
concurrency, and load balancing behavior|to reflect upon the 
broader question of the granularity of processing nodes in high-performance multiprocessors. 
We find that very small caches whose sizes do not increase 
with the problem or machine size are adequate for all but two of 
the application classes. Even in the two exceptions, the working 
sets scale quite slowly with problem size, and the cache sizes 
needed for problems that will be run in the foreseeable future 
are small. We also find that relatively fine-grained machines, 
with large numbers of processors and quite small amounts of 
memory per processor, are appropriate for all the applications.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Recently, several theoretical models of parallel architectures have been proposed to replace the PRAM as the model 
that is presented to an algorithm designer. A primary focus of 
the new models is to include the cost of interprocessor communication, which is increasingly important in modern parallel 
architectures. We argue that modeling the communication costs 
in the architecture or system is only one part of the problem. 
The other, and usually much more difficult, part is modeling 
the communication properties of the algorithm itself, which 
provides necessary inputs into the architectural model to determine overall complexity. In this context, we make three main 
points in this paper: (i) It is incomplete to describe communication without regard to its relationship with replication. We 
propose a description of the communication-replication relationship in terms of the working set hierarchy of an algorithm. 
(ii) Both inherent communication and the communication-replication relationship can be very difficult to model in irregular, dynamic computations that are crucial in many real-world 
applications. We present some examples that demonstrate this 
difficulty. (iii) We believe that substantial leverage can be 
obtained in this effort from the computer systems community, 
which can provide a hierarchy of simulation and profiling 
toolsfrom abstract to detailedtailored to the needs of the 
algorithm designers. We propose an initial set of simulation 
tools, and we discuss possible future refinements to this set.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) provides an inexpensive way to support the popular shared address 
space programming model on networks of workstations or personal computers. Despite recent advances 
in SVM systems, their performance for all but coarse-grained or regular applications is not well understood. 
Nor is there an understanding of whether and how 
fine-grained, irregular programs should be written differently for SVM, with its large granularities of communication and coherence, than for the more familiar 
hardware coherent at cache line granularity. In this 
paper we try to understand the performance and programming issues for emerging, irregular applications 
on SVM systems. We examine performance on both 
an aggressive all-software system as well as one with a 
little hardware support in the network interface. We 
also present approaches to improve the performance 
of irregular applications at both the programming and 
the system level. As a result of our experiences, we 
identify a set of guidelines and techniques that pertain 
specifically to programming SVM systems, beyond the 
guidelines commonly used for programming hardware-coherent systems as well. We also present a further 
relaxation of the memory consistency model, called 
scope consistency, which is particularly effective for

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes network services to support 
large multi-user virtual environments. A client-server design is proposed in which multiple servers 
coordinate execution, manage communication, offload processing, and provide persistent storage for 
their clients. Using this design, it is possible to support real-time features, such as collision detection, 
voice bridging, persistent updates, physical simulation, and autonomous agents, that would be difficult to implement for large virtual environments 
with a peer-to-peer design. The paper includes a 
description of services being implemented in RING, 
a client-server system for interaction between many 
users in large virtual environments.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We simulate a multiagent market with production, consumption, and exchange 
mediated by a sealed-bid double auction. Marked price bubbles and subsequent 
crashes occur when value-based (fundamentals-driven) and trend-based traders are 
both present, and the market equilibrium price is ramped up exogenously. Similarly, 
negative price bubbles and recoveries occur when the equilibrium price is ramped 
down. Because the simulated market is auction-mediated, we can observe the operations of traders during these events, and study the interactions that produce and 
resolve bubbles. Some preliminary circuit-breaker experiments are described, in which 
bubbles are interrupted during their formation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: The paper reports on the application of genetic 
algorithms, probabilistic search algorithms based on the 
model of organic evolution, to NP-complete combinatorial 
optimization problems. In particular, the subset sum, maximum cut, and minimum tardy task problems are considered. 
Except for the fitness function, no problem-specific changes 
of the genetic algorithm are required in order to achieve results of high quality even for the problem instances of size 
100 used in the paper. For constrained problems, such as the 
subset sum and the minimum tardy task, the constraints are 
taken into account by incorporating a graded penalty term 
into the fitness function. Even for large instances of these 
highly multimodal optimization problems, an iterated application of the genetic algorithm is observed to find the global 
optimum within a number of runs. As the genetic algorithm 
samples only a tiny fraction of the search space, these results 
are quite encouraging.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The concept of the global information infrastructure and specifically that of the World 
Wide Web (WWW) has led to users accessing data of different media including images 
and video data over a wide area network. These data objects have sizes the order of 
megabytes and communication time is very large. The data size can be reduced without 
losing information by applying loss-inducing techniques and this will lead to reduction in 
communication time. Several loss-inducing techniques have been developed and each image 
is treated differently by each technique. In some cases an acceptable quality of the image 
is obtained and in some cases it is not. In this paper we develop a color-based technique 
to quantify the data loss when a loss-inducing technique is applied to an image. This will 
result in estimating whether the resulting image is indistinguishable from the original with 
respect to the human eye. We illustrate its use to classify images according to the loss they 
can tolerate. This avoids redundant communication of a high quality image when a lower 
quality image can satisfy the application resulting in the conservation and better usage 
of network resources. We present the technique, the communication time saved, and an 
experimental evaluation to prove the validity of the technique.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents an adaptive protocol for packet-level forward error-correction in dynamic networks. The objective is to facilitate best-effort real-time applications whose timing 
constraints rule out the use of retransmission-based ARQ schemes. The degree of redundancy 
is adjusted as a function of network state, decreasing when the network is well-behaved and 
increasing when it is not. The control problem is nontrivial due to the fact that increased redundancy, beyond a certain level, backfires resulting in self-induced congestion which impedes 
the timely recovery of information at the receiver. 
In the first part of the paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the control problem 
associated with dynamic forward error-correction, concentrating on a particular protocol called 
Adaptive Forward Error-Correction (AFEC). We show that instabilities can arise from two 
distinct sources|desired operating point location and network delay|and we give solutions to 
handle them. The first causal factor is intimately tied to optimality, making its achievement 
potentially perilous in the context of QoS-greedy applications. 
The second part of the paper presents simulation results that confirm the qualitative dynamics predicted by the analysis. We quantitatively estimate the redundancy-recovery rate function 
which relates redundancy to the quality of service rendered at the receiver. We show under what 
conditions the curve's shape is unimodal and to what degree. We compare the performance of 
AFEC against a static FEC protocol in which the redundancy factor is fixed. We show that 
AFEC exhibits superior performance when the network is subject to structural changes that 
persist for nonnegligible durations. Under short-range dependent traffic conditions, AFEC is 
able to closely match the performance of optimum static FEC but not exceed it.  </abstract>

<abstract> 1. ABSTRACT 
Domain specific Problem Solving Environments (PSEs) are the key new ingredients that will aid in the widespread use of Computational Science & Engineering 
(CS&E) systems. Each PSE consists of a well defined library that supports the 
numerical and symbolic solution of certain mathematical model(s) characterizing a 
specific discipline, together with an easy to use software environment. This environment should ideally interact with the user in a language "natural" to the associated 
discipline, and provide a high level abstraction of the underlying, computationally 
complex, model. However, it appears that almost all extant PSEs assume that 
the user is familiar with the specific functionality/applicability of the PSE. Their 
primary design objective is to support some form of high level programming with 
predefined state-of-the-art algorithmic infrastructure. As the functionality of these 
systems increases, the user is expected to make complex decisions in the parametric space of the algorithmic infrastructure supported by the PSE. In this paper 
we describe a knowledge based system, PYTHIA, to automate this decision making process and aid in providing a high level abstraction to the user. Specifically, 
PYTHIA addresses the problem of (parameter, algorithm) pair selection within a 
scientific computing domain assuming some minimum user specified computational 
objectives and some characteristics of the given problem. PYTHIA's framework 
and methodology is general and applicable to any class of scientific problems and  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In the approximate pattern matching problem, the text area to be searched 
for an occurrence of a pattern can be pruned by applying a filtration condition. A q-gram based filtration condition defines potential text areas in terms 
of pattern q-grams, i.e., strings of length q. A text area will be checked by 
an accurate method only if the set of the q-grams in the text area satisfies a 
certain condition. One hopes that the filtration limits the number of checks 
to a minimum, thus making the algorithm quite efficient. However, computer experiments show that the filtration method works fine for cases when 
the allowed error level k is relatively small compared to the pattern length, 
but loses its efficiency quite sharply with an increasing k. This is a phase 
transition phenomenon that is quite often observed in nature. In this paper, 
we present a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon which will excuse 
us to introduce advanced mathematical analysis based on certain languages, 
correlation polynomials, generating functions and complex analysis. It is our 
view that nothing can be more exciting and rewarding than finding a theoretical justification for an abrupt manifestation of nature.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
As databases increasingly integrate non-textual information 
it is becoming necessary to support efficient similarity searching in addition to range searching. Recently, declustering 
techniques have been proposed for improving the performance of similarity searches through parallel I/O. In this 
paper, we propose a new scheme which provides good declus-tering for similarity searching. In particular, it does global 
declustering as opposed to local declustering, exploits the 
availability of extra disks and does not limit the partitioning of the data space. Our technique is based upon the 
Cyclic declustering schemes which were developed for range 
and partial match queries. We establish, in general, that 
Cyclic declustering techniques outperform previously proposed techniques.  </abstract>

<title> A Coarse-Grained Parallel 
QR-Factorization Algorithm for 
Sparse Least Squares Problems  </title>
<author> Tz. Ostromsky P. C. Hansen Z. Zlatev   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
A sparse QR-factorization algorithm SPARQR for coarse-grained parallel 
computations is described. The coefficient matrix, which is assumed to be 
general sparse, is reordered in an attempt to bring as many zero elements in 
the lower left corner as possible. The reordered matrix is then partitioned into 
block rows, and Givens plane rotations are applied in each block-row. These are 
independent tasks and can be done in parallel. Row and column permutations 
are carried out within the diagonal blocks in an attempt to preserve better the 
sparsity of the matrix. 
The algorithm can be used for solving least squares problems either directly 
or combined with an iterative method (preconditioned conjugate gradients are 
used). Small non-zero elements can optionally be dropped in the latter case. 
This leads to a better preservation of the sparsity and, therefore, to a faster 
factorization. The price which has to be paid is some loss of accuracy. The 
iterative method is used to regain the accuracy lost during the factorization. 
Numerical results from several experiments with matrices from the well-known Harwell-Boeing collection as well as with some larger sparse matrices are 
presented in this work. An SGI Power Challenge computer with 16 processors 
has been used in the experiments.  </abstract>

<email> cmr1001@cl.cam.ac.uk  </email>
<abstract> Abstract. This paper introduces a novel method for constructing finite-state machines recognising context free (CF) 
grammars. The method utilizes the idea of a path through 
a finite-state machine (FSM). Certain paths form the basis 
for an unfolding process which is applied to the LR(0) characteristic finite-state machine (CFSM) corresponding to the 
grammar. The next section discusses the approximation algorithm, including this unfolding process, in more detail, and 
section 3 introduces the concept of an unfolding criterion. 
Section 4 proves the soundness of the approximation method, 
and its exactness to arbitrary, fixed recursive depths. Section 
5 presents initial computational figures resulting from an implementation of the method. A variation of the method that 
is more computationally feasible is discussed. The final section compares the method with existing research on finite-state approximation of CF grammars, and presents preliminary conclusions regarding the method.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, we evaluate the use of software distributed 
shared memory (DSM) on a message passing machine as 
the target for a parallelizing compiler. We compare this approach to compiler-generated message passing, hand-coded 
software DSM, and hand-coded message passing. For this 
comparison, we use six applications: four that are regular 
and two that are irregular. 
Our results are gathered on an 8-node IBM SP/2 using the TreadMarks software DSM system. We use the APR 
shared-memory (SPF) compiler to generate the shared memory programs, and the APR XHPF compiler to generate message passing programs. The hand-coded message passing 
programs run with the IBM PVMe optimized message passing library. On the regular programs, both the compiler-generated and the hand-coded message passing outperform 
the SPF/TreadMarks combination: the compiler-generated 
message passing by 5.5% to 40%, and the hand-coded 
message passing by 7.5% to 49%. On the irregular programs, the SPF/TreadMarks combination outperforms the 
compiler-generated message passing by 38% and 89%, and 
only slightly underperforms the hand-coded message passing, differing by 4.4% and 16%. We also identify the factors 
that account for the performance differences, estimate their 
relative importance, and describe methods to improve the 
performance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: An ongoing research project involves the design and evaluation of a software system 
for simulating parallel computers. A major goal in the development of this system was to avoid the 
high overhead associated with the conventional instruction-level simulation of sequential 
computers, but to retain the accuracy of that technique derived from its use of the execution of real 
programs. The resulting system is program-driven, but the overhead is significantly reduced by 
profiling the program to get timing estimates for its basic blocks, which are then used at run time to 
generate process execution times dynamically while avoiding a detailed emulation of each 
instruction's execution. A number of experiments dealing with message-passing computer 
systems have been performed in order to determine the level of accuracy that can be expected from 
its performance predictions and to measure its overhead.  </abstract>

In this paper we describe a formal framework for the problem of mining association rules. The theoretical foundation is based on the field of formal concept analysis. A concept is composed of closed subsets of attributes (itemsets) 
and objects (transactions). We show that all frequent itemsets are uniquely determined by the frequent concepts. We 
further show how this lattice-theoretic framework can be used to find a small rule generating set, from which one can 
infer all other association rules.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We develop a mathematical model for the coating of ceramic fibers by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) in cylindrical hot- or cold-walled reactors. The model couples the 
Navier-Stokes equations for the mixture of a carrier gas and precursor species, an energy 
equation for the gaseous mixture, a convection-diffusion system for the reacting precursor 
species, a fiber coating model, and a fiber heat conduction equation. The system is heated 
by a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation. 
The partial differential system resulting from this model is solved by adaptive finite element software using automatic mesh refinement and coarsening on a quadtree-structured 
mesh. The results of parameter studies indicate the effectiveness of using adaptive solution techniques with CVD applications and also suggest some guidance for improving 
the process.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
An automated design methodology incorporating industry-standard Navier-Stokes 
codes and a gradient-based optimizer has been developed. This system is used to redesign the well-known NASA P2 and P8 hypersonic inlets. First, the Navier-Stokes 
simulations of the original P2 and P8 inlet designs are validated using numerical convergence studies and comparison with wind-tunnel experimental data for the original 
inlets published by NASA in the early 1970s. Second, the P2 and P8 inlets are redesigned with the objective of canceling the cowl shock (and, in the case of the P8 
inlet, the additional cowl-generated compression) at the centerbody by appropriate 
contouring of the centerbody boundary. The original inlets were intended to achieve 
these same objectives, but detailed experimental measurements indicated that a substantial reflected shock system was present. The choice of the objective function, which 
is used to drive the optimization, has a significant impact on the final design. Several 
different formulations for the objective function have been employed, and improvements of 60% to 90% in the objective function have been achieved. This automated 
design system represents one of the first successful combinations of numerical optimization methods with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics simulation for high 
speed inlets, and demonstrates a new area in which High Performance Computing may 
have considerable impact on problems of military and industrial significance.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
People display regularities in almost everything they do. This 
paper proposes characteristics of an idealized algorithm that, 
when applied to sequences of user actions, would allow a user 
interface to adapt over time to an individual's pattern of use. 
We describe a simple predictive method with these characteristics and show its predictive accuracy on a large dataset of 
UNIX commands to be at least as good as others that have 
been considered, while using fewer computational and memory resources.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Massive rule induction has recently emerged as one of the 
powerful data mining techniques. The problem is known to 
be exponential in the size of the attributes, and given its ever 
increasing use, can greatly benefit from parallelization. 
In this paper, we study cost-effective approaches to paral-lelize rule generation algorithms. In particular, we consider 
the propositional rule generation algorithm of the Discovery 
Board system, and present our design and implementation of 
a parallel algorithm for the same task. We then present some 
early performance results of our parallelization scheme on 
hardware and software distributed shared memory multiprocessors.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Models of physical systems can differ according to 
computational cost, accuracy and precision, among 
other things. Depending on the problem solving 
task at hand, different models will be appropriate. Several investigators have recently developed 
methods of automatically selecting among multiple models of physical systems. Our research is 
novel in that we are developing model selection 
techniques specifically suited to computer-aided de 
sign. Our approach is based on the idea that artifact performance models for computer-aided design 
should be chosen in light of the design decisions 
they are required to support. We have developed 
a technique called "Gradient Magnitude Model Selection" (GMMS), which embodies this principle. 
GMMS operates in the context of a hillclimbing 
search process. It selects the simplest model that 
meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm in 
which it operates. We are using the domain of sailing yacht design as a testbed for this research. We 
have implemented GMMS and used it in hillclimb-ing search to decide between a computationally expensive potential-flow program and an algebraic 
approximation to analyze the performance of sailing yachts. Experimental tests show that GMMS 
makes the design process faster than it would be if 
the most expensive model were used for all design 
evaluations. GMMS achieves this performance improvement with little or no sacrifice in the quality 
of the resulting design.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
There is an emerging consensus that an explicit architectural model 
would be invaluable for large evolving software systems, providing them 
with a framework within which such a system can be reasoned about and 
maintained. But the great promise of architectural models has not been 
fulfilled so far, due to a gap between the model and the system it purports 
to describe. It is our contention that this gap is best bridged if the model 
is not just stated, but is enforced. 
This gives rise to a concept enforced architectural model |or, a law | 
which is explored in this paper. We argue that this model has two major beneficial consequences: First, by bridging the above mentioned gap 
between an architectural model and the actual system, an enforced architectural model provides a truly reliable framework within which a system 
can be reasoned about and maintained. Second, our model provides software developers with a carefully circumscribed flexibility in molding the 
law of a project, during its evolutionary lifetime|while maintaining certain architectural principles as invariant of evolution.  </abstract>

The Law of Demeter [4] is accepted as a useful design principle that 
promotes tightly encapsulated classes and reduced coupling. Principles 
like this are routinely adopted in real-life projects, however neither the 
programming languages nor the existing environments provide enough 
support for effective realization of these principles. It is our thesis 
that broad structural principles should be formally specified, strictly 
enforced, and relaxed whenever relaxation is in order. In this paper 
we show how this can be done under our darwin-E environment using, 
the Law of Demeter as an illustration.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes DIDO, a system we have 
developed to carry out exploratory learning of 
unfamiliar domains without assistance from an 
external teacher. The program incorporates novel 
approaches to experience generation and representation 
generation. The experience generator uses a heuristic 
based on Shannon's uncertainty function to find 
informative examples. The representation generator 
makes conjectures on the basis of small amounts of 
evidence and retracts them if they prove to be wrong 
or useless. A number of experiments are described 
which demonstrate that the system can distribute its 
learning resources to steadily acquire a good 
representation of the whole of a domain, and that the 
system can readily acquire both disjunctive and 
conjunctive concepts even in the presence of noise.  </abstract>

Many important scientific problems can be formulated as systems of ordinary differential equations with two-point boundary value constraints (BVODE). Multiple shooting 
is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for solving BVODE problems. 
In this work, we present a new distributed parallel numerical algorithm for BVODEs 
which is based on multiple shooting. We investigate the numerical stability of this 
new distributed algorithm and identify difficulties that can arise. We propose a new 
parallel iterative refinement scheme to cope with some specific numerical difficulties 
identified in our investigation. Computational experience is presented to demonstrate 
the potential effectiveness of our approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present new strategies for "probably approximately correct" (pac) learning that use 
fewer training examples than previous approaches. The idea is to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide "on-line" when to 
return a hypothesis, rather than collect a large 
fixed-size training sample. This yields sequential learning procedures that pac-learn by observing a small random number of examples. 
We provide theoretical bounds on the expected 
training sample size of our procedure | but establish its efficiency primarily by a series of experiments which show sequential learning actually uses many times fewer training examples in 
practice. These results demonstrate that pac-learning can be far more efficiently achieved in 
practice than previously thought.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
While the task of answering queries from an 
arbitrary propositional theory is intractable in 
general, it can typically be performed efficiently 
if the theory is Horn. This suggests that it 
may be more efficient to answer queries using a "Horn approximation"; i.e., a horn theory that is semantically similar to the original 
theory. The utility of any such approximation 
depends on how often it produces answers to 
the queries that the system actually encounters; 
we therefore seek an approximation whose expected "coverage" is maximal. Unfortunately, 
there are several obstacles to achieving this goal 
in practice: (i) The optimal approximation depends on the query distribution, which is typically not known a priori; (ii) identifying the optimal approximation is intractable, even given 
the query distribution; and (iii) the optimal approximation might be too large to guarantee 
tractable inference. This paper presents an approach that overcomes (or side-steps) each of 
these obstacles. We define a learning process, 
AdComp, that uses observed queries to estimate the query distribution "online", and then 
uses these estimates to hill-climb, efficiently, 
in the space of size-bounded Horn approximations, until reaching one that is, with provably 
high probability, effectively at a local optimum.  </abstract>

find duplication of coding segments inside the chromosomes provides a back-up mechanism for the 
search heuristics. We further find local search in a collective memory of coding segments outside of the 
chromosome, collective adaptation, enables the search heuristic to represent partial solutions which are 
larger than realistic chromosomes lengths and to express the solution outside of the chromosome.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
To navigate effectively, an autonomous agent must be 
able to quickly and accurately determine its current 
location. Given an initial estimate of its position (perhaps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of 
a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known 
locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or 
worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for invisible landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of 
its position. To address these problems, we propose a 
method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that 
might be visible, returns the subset which can reliably 
be found correctly, and so provide an accurate registration of the agent's position. We use statistical techniques to prove that the learned selection function is, 
with high probability, effectively at a local optimal in 
the space of such functions. This report also presents 
empirical evidence, using real-world data, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. We propose a method for solving a model of age-dependent population diusion 
with random dispersal. This method, unlike previous methods, allows for variable time steps and 
independent age and time discretizations. We use a moving age discretization that transforms the 
problem to a system of parabolic equations. The system is then solved by backward dierences in 
time and a Galerkin approximation in space; the equations that need to be solved at each step treat 
each age group separately. A priori L 2 error estimates are obtained by an energy analysis. These 
estimates are superconvergent in the age variable. We present a postprocessing technique which 
capitalizes on the superconvergence.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. A new wave of data-intensive and knowledge-based applications|such as data 
mining and decision support|require the introduction of complex application-specific aggregate functions. In this paper, we propose extensions for deductive database systems to 
support these new applications. We develop constructs, formal semantics, and implementation techniques for user-defined aggregates, and describe their realization in an extended 
LDL++ system recently built at UCLA. With these extensions, the system can support online aggregation, roll-ups for data cubing, temporal aggregates for time-series, iceberg queries, 
and other recently proposed operators used in decision support and data mining procedures. 
We then discuss the application of this technology to other DBMSs, and in particular to the 
SQL3 specifications that support the notion of user-defined aggregates. We show that SQL3 
suffers from limitations that severely restrict its use in new applications; thus we propose 
simple extensions similar to those used for LDL++ to overcome such limitations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In the design of algorithms, the greedy paradigm provides a powerful tool for solving 
efficiently classical computational problems, within the framework of procedural languages. However, expressing these algorithms within the declarative framework of logic-based languages has proved to be a difficult research challenge. In this paper, we extend the framework of Datalog-like languages to obtain simple declarative formulations 
for such problems, and propose effective implementation techniques to ensure computational complexities comparable to those of procedural formulations. These advances are 
achieved through the use of the choice construct, that has semantics reducible to that of 
programs with negation under stable model semantics. Then we extend the fixpoint-based 
semantics of choice programs with preference annotations to guide search strategies and 
simple logic-based formulations of classical greedy algorithms.  </abstract>

<address> Santa Barbara, CA 93106  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
Recovery from failures is important in distributed computing. A common technique to support 
recovery is asynchronous checkpointing, coupled with optimistic message logging. These schemes have 
low overheads during failure-free operations and can provide an acceptable degree of fault-tolerance. 
Central to these protocols is the determination of a maximal consistent global state, which is recoverable. 
Message semantics is not exploited in most existing recovery protocols to determine the recoverable state. 
We propose to identify messages that are not influential in the computation through message semantics. 
These messages can be logically removed from the computation without changing its meaning or result. 
In this paper, we illustrate with examples how the removal of these messages improves the theoretical 
maximal consistent global state. Taking semantics into account, recovery protocols are then developed 
to realize the idea. The semantics in object-oriented databases is adapted to special processes acting as 
servers for further improvements. This technique can also be applied to ensure a more timely commitment 
for output in a distributed computation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Run-time compilation techniques have been shown effective 
for automating the parallelization of loops with unstructured 
indirect data accessing patterns. However, it is still an open 
problem to efficiently parallelize sparse matrix factorizations 
commonly used in iterative numerical problems. The difficulty is that a factorization process contains irregularly-interleaved communication and computation with varying 
granularities and it is hard to obtain scalable performance 
on distributed memory machines. In this paper, we present 
an inspector/executor approach for parallelizing such applications by embodying automatic graph scheduling techniques to optimize interleaved communication and computation. We describe a run-time system called RAPID that 
provides a set of library functions for specifying irregular 
data objects and tasks that access these objects. The system 
extracts a task dependence graph from data access patterns, 
and executes tasks efficiently on a distributed memory machine. We discuss a set of optimization strategies used in 
this system and demonstrate the application of this system 
in parallelizing sparse Cholesky and LU factorizations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a general framework for computing invariant features from images. The proposed 
approach is based on a simple concept of basis expansion. It is widely applicable to many popular 
basis representations, such as wavelets [4, 5, 24, 25], short-time Fourier analysis [15, 30], and 
splines [2, 6, 33]. Exploiting formulations that use both global and local information about 
shape and color, the new approach is neither strictly global nor local. It has the advantage of 
tolerating a certain degree of occlusion (unlike global analysis) and does not require estimating 
high-order derivatives in computing invariants (unlike local analysis), whence is more robust. 
Furthermore, it enables a quasi-localized, hierarchical shape analysis which is not possible with 
other known invariant techniques. Unlike most current research on image invariants which 
concentrates on either geometry or illumination invariants, the proposed framework is very 
general and produces invariants which are insensitive to rigid motion, general affine transform, 
changes of parameterization and scene illumination, and perspective transform.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Two operations commute if the result of their execution is independent of the order in which they execute. Commuting operations can be executed 
concurrently provided they execute atomically on the objects they access. Statically 
recognizing commuting operations is of great interest because they increase the amount 
of concurrency a compiler can exploit. In this document we introduce commutativity 
analysis anew technique for automatically parallelizing serial programs. We then 
conduct a feasibility study of existing scientific applications as to the existence and 
exploitability of commuting operations. We study the commuting operations present 
in one such application the Barnes-Hut hierarchical N-body algorithm. We then 
parallelize this application using knowledge of commuting operations and present performance results of the parallel code for a shared-memory multiprocessor.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes a set of classes designed to 
facilitate concurrent programming using the sequential object-oriented language EIFFEL. The design and 
implementation presented here is the application of a 
more general Concurrency Model we have built to introduce concurrency to sequential OOPLs. The model 
views concurrency as a well-defined, inheritable property of objects specified in the class CONCURRENCY, 
and provides a methodology using inheritance to write 
concurrent object-orient applications. Key ideas involved in the methodology are: active objects, extensibility of protocols, synchronization programming, 
data-driven synchronization with asynchronous message passing. 
The novel feature of our work is in its describing 
concurrency in the context of sequential programming 
and using a object-oriented design methodology to describe and implement it. 
We illustrate the usefulness and expressiveness of

<abstract> Abstract 
The Scintilla project at UCSB studies SCI-based cluster 
computing. The Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) is a 
recent communication standard for cluster interconnects. 
We focus on non-coherent SCI, using our cluster setup 
of SBus-based and PCI-based workstations connected via 
Dolphin SCI adapters. Our motivation for choosing SCI as 
network fabric is the very low latency and high bandwidth. 
We study how to map a variety of programming models efficiently onto the SCI hardware, focusing on message 
passing and global address space support, implementing 
Active Messages and Split-C. We present implementation 
trade-offs, present performance measurements and compare the PCI and SBus adapters. 
We found that the user-level load/store programming interface of SCI is very convenient to use, achieves low latencies, and is fully virtualized, simultaneously supporting 
multiple parallel programs and communication channels. 
On the other hand, neither of the programming models 
studied maps directly to SCI. Issues such as notification, 
atomic operations, and virtual address space limitations 
represent major implementation challenges, which we address with a combination of compiler and run-time support. Overall, we found the SCI network a good substrate 
for high-performance cluster computing.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Automatic scheduling for directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and its applications for coarse-grained irregular problems such as large n-body simulation have been studied in the literature. 
However solving irregular problems with mixed granularities such as sparse matrix factorization 
is challenging since it requires efficient run-time support to execute a DAG schedule. In this 
paper, we investigate run-time optimization techniques for executing general asynchronous 
DAG schedules on distributed memory machines. Our solution tightly integrates the run-time 
scheme with a fast communication mechanism to eliminate unnecessary overhead in message 
buffering and copying. We discuss a consistency model incorporating the above optimizations, 
and taking advantage of task dependence properties to ensure the correctness of execution. 
We demonstrate the applications of this scheme in sparse factorizations and triangular solver 
for which actual speedups are hard to obtain. Our experiments on Meiko CS-2 show that the 
automatically scheduled code has achieved scalable performance for these problems and the 
run-time overhead is small compared to the total execution time.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Papadimitriou introduced several classes of NP search problems based on combinatorial principles which guarantee the 
existence of solutions to the problems. Many interesting 
search problems not known to be solvable in polynomial 
time are contained in these classes, and a number of them 
are complete problems. We consider the question of the relative complexity of these search problem classes. We prove 
several separations which show that in a generic relativized 
world, the search classes are distinct and there is a standard 
search problem in each of them that is not computation-ally equivalent to any decision problem. (Naturally, absolute separations would imply that P 6= NP.) Our separation 
proofs have interesting combinatorial content and go to the 
heart of the combinatorial principles on which the classes are 
based. We derive one result via new lower bounds on the 
degrees of polynomials asserted to exist by Hilbert's Null-stellensatz over finite fields.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Fast networks have made it possible to coordinate distributed heterogeneous CPU, 
memory and storage resources to provide a powerful platform for executing high-performance applications. However, the performance of parallel applications on such 
systems is highly dependent on the mapping of application tasks to machines. In this 
paper, we propose a mapping strategy for applications formed by multiple tasks targeted 
to heterogeneous platforms. We first define a mapping model, the match-tree, which 
reects the data movement and conversion costs of distributed algorithms and allows for 
alternative implementations of individual tasks on different machines. We then define the 
find-mapping and split-partition algorithms, based on the match-tree model, to 
determine the best allocation of tasks to resources in heterogeneous systems. We 
illustrate the use of these algorithms with a sample distributed application.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Execution speed of programs on modern computer architectures is sensitive, by a factor of two or more, to the order in which instructions 
are presented to the processor. To realize potential execution efficiency, 
it is now customary for an optimizing compiler to employ a heuristic 
algorithm for instruction scheduling. These algorithms are painstakingly 
hand-crafted, which is expenseive and time-consuming. We show how 
to cast the instruction scheduling problem as a learning task, so that one 
obtains the heuristic scheduling algorithm automatically. Our focus is the 
narrower problem of scheduling straight-line code, also known as a basic 
block of instructions. Our empirical results show that just a few features 
are adequate for quite good performance at this task for a real modern 
processor, and that any of several supervised learning methods perform 
nearly optimally with respect to the features used.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Planning and learning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is a key 
problem for artificial intelligence. In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov 
decision processes and reinforcement learning. Current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent 
common-sense higher-level actions, such as going to lunch, grasping an 
object, or flying to Denver. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models [Sutton, 1995] and extends it from the prediction 
setting to include actions, control, and planning. We introduce a more 
general form of temporally abstract model, the multi-time model, and establish its suitability for planning and learning by virtue of its relationship 
to the Bellman equations. This paper summarizes the theoretical framework of multi-time models and illustrates their potential advantages in a 
gridworld planning task.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Several researchers have proposed modeling 
temporally abstract actions in reinforcement 
learning by the combination of a policy and a termination condition, which we refer to as an option. Value functions over options and models of 
options can be learned using methods designed 
for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). 
However, all these methods require an option to 
be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from 
small fragments of experience consistent with 
that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience 
within an option. Intra-option methods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporal-difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously 
about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the 
consequences of options. We present computational examples in which these new methods 
learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn 
effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at 
all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intra 
option value learning.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The increasing development of mobile networks 
raises new security requirements and concerns. In addition to the basic need of authentication, confidentiality and key distribution services, a new problem involving privacy is the unauthorized tracking of users' 
migration. In other words, accessing any information 
related to the mobile user's location data without his 
consent, is a serious violation of his privacy. Moreover, if no care is taken, the disclosure of the mobile 
user real identity may appear during the authentication process. The basic solution to this problem is the 
use of aliases which insure non-traceability by hiding 
the user's real identity and also his relationship with 
domain authorities. In this paper we provide a classification of the different degrees of non-traceability and 
present a new efficient method for the computation of 
aliases. This technique can be used during authentication of mobile users and thus avoids the drawbacks of 
existing solutions such as GSM and CDPD.  </abstract>

<title> Composite Model Checking with Type Specific 
Symbolic Encodings   </title>
<author> Tevfik Bultan Richard Gerber  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Science 
University of Maryland, </affiliation> <address> College Park, MD 20742, USA  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present a new symbolic model checking technique, which analyzes temporal properties in multi-typed transition systems. Specifically, the method uses multiple type-specific data encodings to represent 
system states, and it carries out fixpoint computations via the corresponding type-specific symbolic 
operations. In essence, different symbolic encodings are unified into one composite model checker. Any 
type-specific language can be included in this framework provided that the language is closed under 
Boolean connectives, propositions can be checked for satisfiability, and relational images can be computed. 
Our technique relies on conjunctive partitioning of transition relations of atomic events based on variable 
types involved, which allows independent computation of one-step pre- and post-conditions for each 
variable type. 
In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a nontrivial data-transfer protocol, 
which contains a mixture of integer and Boolean-valued variables. The protocol operates over an unreliable channel that can lose, duplicate or reorder messages. Moreover, the protocol's send and receive 
window sizes are not specified in advance; rather, they are represented as symbolic constants. The resulting system was automatically verified using our composite model checking approach, in concert with 
a conservative approximation technique.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Unlike wired links, wireless network bandwidth is highly limited 
and the channel usually suffers from frequent and bursty loss due 
to its vulnerability to various kinds of interference. At the same 
time, the traditional TCP with its congestion control is well known 
for its poor performance over wireless links. This paper proposes 
a new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link by 
a simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hop 
along a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate with 
an Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the base 
station, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from the outside Internet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments and re-transmissions to quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Our 
simulation results show a substantial performance improvement 
achieved by the new protocol.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Association Rule Mining algorithms operate 
on a data matrix (e.g., customers fi products) 
to derive association rules [2, 23]. We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, 
which are quantifiable in that we can measure 
the "goodness" of a set of discovered rules. 
We propose to use the "guessing error" as a 
measure of the "goodness", that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values 
of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that 
our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our 
rules can "guess" the amount spent on, say, 
butter. Thus, we can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering 
"what-if" scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show how to 
compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the 
dataset with small memory requirements (a 
few small matrices), in contrast to traditional 
association rule mining methods that require 
multiple passes and/or large memory. Experiments  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes Dynamic Abstraction Planning 
(DAP), an abstraction planning technique that improves the efficiency of state-enumeration planners for 
real-time embedded systems such as CIRCA. Abstraction is used to remove detail from the state representation, reducing both the size of the state space that 
must be explored to produce a plan and the size of the 
resulting plan. The intuition behind this approach is 
simple: in some situations, certain world features are 
important, while in other situations those same features are not important. 
By automatically selecting the appropriate level of abstraction at each step during the planning process, 
DAP can significantly reduce the size of the search 
space. Furthermore, the planning process can supply 
initial plans that preserve safety but might, on further 
refinement, do a better job of goal achievement. DAP 
can also terminate with an executable abstract plan, 
which may be much smaller than the corresponding 
plan expanded to precisely-defined states. Preliminary 
results show dramatic improvements in planning speed 
and scalability.  </abstract>

<title> Quantum Computing | A treatise  </title>

<date> October 24, 1996  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
Quantum computing has witnessed a surge of activity recently owing 
to some very exciting discoveries on both the theoretical and practical 
fronts. In this overview, we sketch an account of the developments in 
this scientifically intriguing field, starting in the early 80's when the first 
questions about the computability of quantum processes were raised, 
and which led to the formal definitions of a Quantum Computer and a 
Quantum Complexity Theory. Peter Shor's recent remarkable discovery of quantum algorithms to solve the problems of integer factoring 
and discrete log computing, which are believed to be extremely hard to 
solve efficiently on classical computers, is a compelling demonstration 
of the suspected superiority of quantum computing over the classical 
model that is in use today. We discuss one of his algorithms and the 
implications it has for classical cryptography. We discuss some of the 
latest work in this field which has brought us yet closer to achieving a 
physical realization of a quantum computer. Whenever it happens, if it 
happens, it would be yet another revolution in the field of computing, 
and maybe the biggest one to date.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Most case-based reasoning systems have used a 
single "best" or "most similar" case as the basis 
for a solution. For many problems, however, 
there is no single exact solution. Rather, there 
is a range of acceptable answers. We use cases 
not only as a basis for a solution, but also to 
indicate the boundaries within which a solution 
can be found. We solve problems by choosing 
some point within those boundaries. 
In this paper, I discuss this use of cases with 
illustrations from chiron, a system I have implemented in the domain of personal income 
tax planning.  </abstract>

<title> A Comparison of Content-Based Image/Video Retrieval 
Systems  </title>
<author> Fatma Ozcan  </author>
<date> December 15, 1997  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
Recently, content-based retrieval of images and video has become a hot research area. The reason for this 
is the need for effective and efficient techniques, that meet user requirements, to access large volumes of digital 
images and video data. In [GR 95], previous approaches to content-based retrieval is said to have taken two 
directions. In the first approach, image contents are modeled as a set of attributes extracted manually and 
managed within the framework of conventional database-management systems. The second approach depends 
on an integrated feature-extraction/object-recognition subsystem to overcome the limitations of attribute-based retrieval. However, it has been also stated that [GR 95] recent content-based image retrieval systems 
recognized the need for synergy between these two approaches. 
There has been numerous efforts to build content-based image retrieval systems. These include, Chabot 
[OS 95], SCORE [ATY 95, ATY 96], CONIVAS [AD 96], Photobook [PPS 93], CANDID [KCH 95], JACOB 
[ALDV 96, LA 96], VisualSEEk [SC 96] and QBIC [FSN+ 95]. In the first place, these systems differ in their 
querying capabilities. Images could be retrieved through the use of color, texture, sketch, shape, volume, 
spatial constraints, browsing, motion, text and domain concepts. Current approaches to content-based image 
retrieval also differ in terms of image features extracted, their level of abstraction and the degree of domain 
independence. In this paper, a comparative survey on these systems is conducted to figure out design tradeoffs 
and different approaches to content-based image retrieval. Furthermore, a taxonomy of content-based retrieval 
systems, as well as a generic architecture, is provided.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Ad hoc querying is difficult on very large datasets, since it 
is usually not possible to have the entire dataset on disk. 
While compression can be used to decrease the size of the 
dataset, compressed data is notoriously difficult to index 
or access. 
In this paper we consider a very large dataset comprising multiple distinct time sequences. Each point in the 
sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress 
such a dataset into a format that supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the 
data is uncompressed. Experiments on large, real world 
datasets (AT&T customer calling patterns) show that the 
proposed method achieves an average of less than 5% error 
in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5% of the 
original space (i.e., a 40:1 compression ratio), with these 
numbers not very sensitive to dataset size. Experiments 
on aggregate queries achieved a 0.5% reconstruction error 
with a space requirement under 2%.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
All mechanical designs pass through a series of formal and informal redesign steps, involving the analysis of functionality, manufacturability, cost and other life-cycle factors. The 
speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from 
conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically 
generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. 
Given an interpretation of the design as a collection of machinable features, our approach 
is to generate alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the original 
features, and add them to the feature set of the original part to create an extended feature 
set. The designer may provide restrictions on the design indicating the type and extent of 
modifications allowed on certain faces and volumes, in which case all redesign suggestions 
generated by our approach honor those restrictions. 
By taking combinations of features from the extended feature set generated above, we can 
generate modified versions of the original design that still satisfy the designer's intent. By 
considering precedence constraints and approach directions for the machining operations as 
well as simple fixturability constraints, we can estimate the setup time that will be required 
for each design. Any modified design whose setup time is less than that of the original 
design can be presented to the designer as a possible way to modify the original design.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: A transport protocol that supports real-time communication of 
audio/video frames across campus-area packet switched networks is presented. 
It is a best effort protocol that attempts to ameliorate the effect of jitter, load 
variation, and packet loss, to provide low latency, synchronized audio and video 
communications. This goal is realized through four transport and display 
mechanisms, and a real-time implementation of these mechanisms that 
integrates operating system services ( e.g., scheduling and resource allocation, 
and device management) with network communication services ( e.g., transport 
protocols), and with application code ( e.g., display routines). The four 
mechanisms are: a facility for varying the synchronization between audio and 
video to achieve continuous audio in the face of jitter, a network congestion 
monitoring mechanism that is used to control audio/video latency, a queueing 
mechanism at the sender that is used to maximize frame throughput without 
unnecessarily increasing latency, and a forward error correction mechanism for 
transmitting audio frames multiple times to ameliorate the effects of packet loss 
in the network. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated by 
measuring the performance of the protocol when transmitting audio and video 
across congested networks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple- 
time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a high speed 
network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most 
effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit 
rate. 
We present two basic results. First, we present an optimal 
smoothing algorithm for achieving the greatest possible reduction 
in rate variability when transmitting stored video to a client with 
given buffer size. We provide a formal proof of optimality, and 
demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of long 
MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact 
of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video 
transport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guar- 
anteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. 
Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to be 
dramatic.  </abstract>

There is increasing demand to extend CORBA to support 
applications with stringent real-time requirements. However, conventional CORBA Object Request Brokers (ORBs) 
exhibit substantial priority inversion and non-determinism, 
which makes them unsuitable for applications with deterministic real-time requirements. This paper focuses on software 
architectures that help to alleviate priority inversion and non-determinism in real-time CORBA ORBs. It also illustrates empirically why conventional ORBs do not yet support real-time 
quality of service.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We have developed compiler algorithms that analyze explicitly parallel programs and restructure their shared data to 
reduce the number of false sharing misses. The algorithms 
analyze per-process shared data accesses, pinpoint the data 
structures that are susceptible to false sharing and choose 
an appropriate transformation to reduce it. The transformations either group data that is accessed by the same processor or separate individual data items that are shared. 
This paper evaluates that technique. We show through 
simulation that our analysis successfully identifies the data 
structures that are responsible for most false sharing misses, 
and then transforms them without unduly decreasing spatial 
locality. The reduction in false sharing positively impacts 
both execution time and program scalability when executed 
on a KSR2. Both factors combine to increase the maximum 
achievable speedup for all programs, more than doubling 
it for several. Despite being able to only approximate actual inter-processor memory accesses, the compiler-directed 
transformations always outperform programmer efforts to 
eliminate false sharing.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper reports on the design and implementation of a practical shape analysis for C. The purpose of the analysis is to aid in the disambiguation of 
heap-allocated data structures by estimating the shape 
(Tree, DAG, or Cyclic Graph) of the data structure accessible from each heap-directed pointer. This shape 
information can be used to improve dependence testing and in parallelization, and to guide the choice of 
more complex heap analyses. 
The method has been implemented as a context-sensitive interprocedural analysis in the McCAT compiler. Experimental results and observations are given 
for 16 benchmark programs. These results show that 
the analysis gives accurate and useful results for an 
important group of applications.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Real-time continuous media traffic, such as digital video and audio, is expected 
to comprise a large percentage of the network load on future high speed packet 
switch networks such as ATM. A major feature which distinguishes high speed 
networks from traditional slower speed networks is the large amount of data the 
network must manage. For efficient network usage, traffic control mechanisms are 
essential. Currently, most mechanisms for traffic control (such as flow control) 
have centered on the support of Available Bit Rate (ABR), i.e., non real-time, 
traffic. With regard to ATM, for ABR traffic, two major types of schemes which 
have been proposed are rate-control and credit-control schemes. Neither of these 
schemes are directly applicable to Real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic such 
as continuous media traffic. Traffic control for continuous media traffic is an inherently difficult problem due to the time-sensitive nature of the traffic and its 
unpredictable burstiness. In this study, we present a scheme which controls traffic by dynamically allocating/de-allocating resources among competing VCs based 
upon their real-time requirements. This scheme incorporates a form of rate-control, 
real-time burst-level scheduling and link-link flow control. We show analytically potential performance improvements of our rate-control scheme and present a scheme 
for buffer dimensioning. We also present simulation results of our schemes and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in maintaining high network utilization and statistically 
guaranteeing many users' Quality of Service.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we present a parallel formulation of a multilevel k-way graph partitioning algorithm. The multilevel 
k-way partitioning algorithm reduces the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges (coarsening phase), finds 
a k-way partitioning of the smaller graph, and then it constructs a k-way partitioning for the original graph by projecting and refining the partition to successively finer graphs (uncoarsening phase). A key innovative feature of our 
parallel formulation is that it utilizes graph coloring to effectively parallelize both the coarsening and the refinement 
during the uncoarsening phase. Our algorithm is able to achieve a high degree of concurrency, while maintaining the 
high quality partitions produced by the serial algorithm. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs from finite 
element methods, and transportation domains. For graphs with a million vertices, our parallel formulation produces 
high quality 128-way partitions on 128 processors in a little over two seconds, on Cray T3D. Thus our parallel algorithm makes it feasible to perform frequent dynamic graph partition in adaptive computations without compromising 
quality.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Query optimization for parallel machines needs to 
consider machine architecture, processor and memory 
resources available, and different types of parallelism, 
making the search space much larger than the sequential case. In this paper our aim is to determine a plan 
that makes the execution of an individual query very 
fast, making minimizing parallel execution time the 
right objective. This creates the following circular dependence: a plan tree is needed for effective resource 
assignment, which is needed to estimate the parallel 
execution time, and this is needed for the cost-based 
search for a good plan tree. In this paper we propose 
a new search heuristic that breaks the cycle by constructing the plan tree layer by layer in a bottom-up 
manner. To select nodes at the next level, the lower 
and upper bounds on the execution time for plans consistent with the decisions made so far are estimated 
and are used to guide the search. A query plan representation for intra- and inter-operator parallelism, 
pipelining, and processor and memory assignment is 
proposed. Also proposed is a new approach to estimating the parallel execution time of a plan that considers 
sum and max of operators working sequentially and 
in parallel, respectively. The results obtained from a 
prototype optimizer are presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> abstract: Building distributed operating systems benefits from the micro-kernel approach by allowing better support for modularization. However, we believe 
that we need to take this support a step further. A more modular, or object 
oriented approach is needed if we wish to cross the barrier of complexity that 
is holding back distributed operating system development. The Chorus Ob 
ject Oriented Layer (COOL) is a layer built above the Chorus micro-kernel 
designed to extend the micro-kernel abstractions with support for object oriented systems. COOL v2, the second iteration of this layer provides generic 
support for clusters of objects, in a distributed virtual memory model. It is 
built as a layered system where the lowest layer support only clusters and the 
upper layers support objects.  </abstract>

<title> A Framework for Implementing Objects and Scheduling Tasks in Lock-Free

<affiliation> Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present an integrated framework for developing real-time systems in which lock-free algorithms are employed to 
implement shared objects. There are two key objectives of 
our work. The first is to enable functionality for object sharing in lock-free real-time systems that is comparable to that 
in lock-based systems. Our main contribution toward this 
objective is an efficient approach for implementing multi-object lock-free operations and transactions. A second key 
objective of our work is to improve upon previously proposed 
scheduling conditions for tasks that share lock-free objects. 
When developing such conditions, the key issue is to bound 
the cost of operation interferences. We present a general 
approach for doing this, based on linear programming.  </abstract>

<title> Universal Constructions for Large Objects  </title>

<affiliation> Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present lock-free and wait-free universal constructions for implementing large 
shared objects. Most previous universal constructions require processes to copy the 
entire object state, which is impractical for large objects. Previous attempts to 
address this problem require programmers to explicitly fragment large objects into 
smaller, more manageable pieces, paying particular attention to how such pieces are 
copied. In contrast, our constructions are designed to largely shield programmers 
from this fragmentation. Furthermore, for many objects, our constructions result 
in lower copying overhead than previous ones. 
Fragmentation is achieved in our constructions through the use of load-linked, 
store-conditional, and validate operations on a "large" multi-word shared variable. 
Before presenting our constructions, we show that these operations can be efficiently 
implemented from similar one-word primitives.  </abstract>

<title> View-Dependent Simplification Of Arbitrary Polygonal Environments  </title>
<author> David Luebke, Carl Erikson  </author>

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  </affiliation>
<abstract> 1. ABSTRACT 
Hierarchical dynamic simplification (HDS) is a new approach to 
the problem of simplifying arbitrary polygonal environments. 
HDS operates dynamically, retessellating the scene continuously 
as the users viewing position shifts, and adaptively, processing 
the entire database without first decomposing the environment 
into individual objects. The resulting system allows real-time 
display of very complex polygonal CAD models consisting of 
thousands of parts and hundreds of thousands of polygons. HDS 
supports various preprocessing algorithms and various runtime 
criteria, providing a general framework for dynamic view-dependent simplification. 
Briefly, HDS works by clustering vertices together in a 
hierarchical fashion. The simplification process continuously 
queries this hierarchy to generate a scene containing only those 
polygons that are important from the current viewpoint. When 
the volume of space associated with a vertex cluster occupies less 
than a userspecified amount of the screen, all vertices within 
that cluster are collapsed together and degenerate polygons 
filtered out. HDS maintains an active list of visible polygons for 
rendering. Since frame-to-frame movements typically involve 
small changes in viewpoint, and therefore modify the active list 
by only a few polygons, the method takes advantage of temporal 
coherence for greater speed.

<abstract> Abstract 
Precise teleoperation of dextrous robotic hands by 
hand masters requires an accurate human hand model. 
A kinematic model of a human index finger is developed as an example for human hand modeling. The 
parameters of the model are determined by open-loop 
kinematic calibration. Singular value decomposition is 
used as a tool for analyzing the kinematic model and 
the identification process. Accurate and reliable results are obtained only when the numerical condition 
is minimized through parameter scaling, model reduction and pose set selection. The identified kinematic 
parameters show the kinematic model and calibration 
procedure have an accuracy on the order of a few millimeters.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe the design and implementation of a persistent object storage facility 
based on a dossier driven approach. Objects are characterized by dossiers which describe both their language defined and "extra-linguistic" properties. These dossiers are 
generated by a C++ preprocessor in concert with an augmented, but completely C++ 
compatible, class description language. The design places very few burdens on the application programmer and can be used without altering the data member layout of application objects or inheriting from special classes. The storage format is kept simple to allow 
the use of a variety of data storage backends. In addition, these dossiers can be used to 
implement (or augment) a run-time typing facility compatible with the proposed ANSI 
C++ standard. Finally, by providing a generic object to byte stream conversion the persistent object facility can also be used in conjunction with an interprocess communication 
facility to provide object-level communication between processes. 1  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Software for a growing number of problem domains 
has complex, time varying behavior and unpredictable 
resource demands (e.g., WWW servers and parallel input/output systems). While current performance analysis tools provide insights into application dynamics 
and the causes of poor performance, with a posteriori analysis one cannot adapt to temporally varying 
application resource demands and system responses. 
We believe that the solution to this performance optimization conundrum is integration of dynamic performance instrumentation and on-the-fly performance 
data reduction with real-time adaptive control mechanisms that select and configure resource management 
algorithms automatically, based on observed application behavior, or interactively, through high-modality 
virtual environments. We motivate this belief by first 
describing our experiences with performance analysis tools, input/output characterization, and WWW 
server analysis, and then sketching the design of interactive and closed loop adaptive control systems.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. This paper describes the first results from research 1 on the 
compilation of constraint systems into task level parallel programs in a 
procedural language. This is the only research, of which we are aware, 
which attempts to generate efficient parallel programs for numerical 
computations from constraint systems. Computations are expressed as 
constraint systems. A dependence graph is derived from the constraint 
system and a set of input variables. The dependence graph, which exploits the parallelism in the constraints, is mapped to the target language CODE, which represents parallel computation structures as generalized dependence graphs. Finally, parallel C programs are generated. 
The granularity of the derived dependence graphs depends upon the 
complexity of the operations represented in the type system of the constraint specification language. To extract parallel programs of appropriate granularity, the following features have been included: (i) modularity, (ii) operations over structured types as primitives, (iii) definition 
of sequential C functions. A prototype of the compiler has been implemented. The execution environment or software architecture is specified 
separately from the constraint system. The domain of matrix computations has been targeted for applications. Some examples have been 
programmed. Initial results are very encouraging.  </abstract>

<title> Optimal Wire-Sizing Formula Under the Elmore Delay Model  </title>
<author> Chung-Ping Chen, Yao-Ping Chen, and D. F. Wong  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas, </affiliation> <address> Austin, Texas 78712  </address>
<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, we consider non-uniform wire-sizing. Given a 
wire segment of length L, let f(x) be the width of the wire 
at position x, 0 x L. We show that the optimal wire-sizing function that minimizes the Elmore delay through the 
wire is f(x) = ae bx , where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants 
that can be computed in O(1) time. In the case where lower 
bound (L &gt; 0) and upper bound (U &gt; 0) on the wire widths 
are given, we show that the optimal wire-sizing function f(x) 
is a truncated version of ae bx that can also be determined in 
O(1) time. Our wire-sizing formula can be iteratively applied 
to optimally size the wire segments in a routing tree.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Qualitative reasoning uses incomplete knowledge to compute a description of the possible behaviors for dynamic 
systems. For complex systems containing a large number 
of variables and constraints, the simulation frequently is 
intractable or results in a large, incomprehensible behavioral description. Abstraction and aggregation techniques are required during the simulation to eliminate 
irrelevant details and highlight the important characteristics of the behavior. The total temporal ordering of 
unrelated events provided by a traditional state-based 
qualitative representation is one such irrelevant distinction. Model decomposition and simulation addresses this 
problem. 
Model decomposition uses a causal analysis of the model 
to partition the variables into tightly connected components. The components are simulated separately in 
the order dictated by the causal analysis beginning with 
causally upstream components. Information from the 
simulation of causally upstream components is used to 
constrain the behavior of downstream components. If a 
feedback loop exists between components or a set of components are acausally related, then a concurrent simulation is performed for these components. A truth maintenance system is used to record and retract assumptions 
made during this concurrent simulation. 
Model decomposition provides a general architecture 
which separates the method of simulation from the model 
decomposition algorithm. This architecture can be used 
to introduce alternative abstraction techniques to eliminate other irrelevant distinctions.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
MAWL is an application language for programming interactive services in the context of the Worldwide 
Web. The language is small, because no construct was introduced without compelling justification; as with 
yacc [8], general-purpose computation is done in a host language. MAWL offers conveniences such as control 
abstraction, persistent state management, synchronization, and shared memory. In addition, the MAWL 
compiler performs static checking designed to prevent common Web programming errors. In this paper we 
discuss the design and engineering of MAWL. 
We describe the problems MAWL is intended to solve, and then discuss our design choices in the context 
of our general language design philosophy, We also include an appendix of commentary on several short 
MAWL programs.  </abstract>

<title> ON UNAPPROXIMABLE VERSIONS OF NP-COMPLETE 
PROBLEMS   </title>
<author> DAVID ZUCKERMAN   </author>
<abstract> Abstract. 
We prove that all of Karp's 21 original NP -complete problems have a version that's hard to 
approximate. These versions are obtained from the original problems by adding essentially the same, 
simple constraint. We further show that these problems are absurdly hard to approximate. In fact, no 
polynomial-time algorithm can even approximate log (k) of the magnitude of these problems to within 
any constant factor, where log (k) denotes the logarithm iterated k times, unless N P is recognized by 
slightly superpolynomial randomized machines. We use the same technique to improve the constant 
* such that MAX CLIQUE is hard to approximate to within a factor of n * . Finally, we show that it 
is even harder to approximate two counting problems: counting the number of satisfying assignments 
to a monotone 2-SAT formula and computing the permanent of -1,0,1 matrices.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The ideal distributed file system would provide all its users with coherent, shared access to the same set of files,yet would be arbitrarily 
scalable to provide more storage space and higher performance to 
a growing user community. It would be highly available in spite of 
component failures. It would require minimal human administration, and administration would not become more complex as more 
components were added. 
Frangipani is a new file system that approximates this ideal, yet 
was relatively easy to build because of its two-layer structure. The 
lower layer is Petal (described in an earlier paper), a distributed 
storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly available, automatically managed virtual disks. In the upper layer, 
multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top 
of a shared Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to 
ensure coherence. 
Frangipani is meant to run in a cluster of machines that are under 
a common administration and can communicate securely. Thus the 
machines trust one another and the shared virtual disk approach is 
practical. Of course, a Frangipani file system can be exported to 
untrusted machines using ordinary network file access protocols. 
We have implemented Frangipani on a collection of Alphas 
running DIGITAL Unix 4.0. Initial measurements indicate that 
Frangipani has excellent single-server performance and scales well 
as servers are added.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Message logging is a popular technique for building low-overhead protocols that tolerate 
process crash failures. Past research in message logging has focused on studying the relative 
overhead imposed by pessimistic, optimistic, and causal protocols during failure-free executions. In this paper, we give the first experimental evaluation of the performance of these 
protocols during recovery. We discover that, if a single failure is to be tolerated, pessimistic 
and causal protocols perform best, because they avoid rollbacks of correct processes. For 
multiple failures, however, the dominant factor in determining performance becomes where 
the recovery information is logged (i.e. at the sender, at the receiver, or replicated at a 
subset of the processes in the system) rather than when this information is logged (i.e. if 
logging is synchronous or asynchronous). From our results, we distil a few lessons that can 
guide the design of message-logging protocols that combine low-overhead during failure-free 
executions with fast recovery.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We address the problem of broadcasting on mesh architectures with arbitrary (non-power-two) dimensions. It is assumed that such mesh architectures employ cut-through or worm-hole routing. The 
primary focus is on avoiding network conflicts in the various proposed algorithms. We give algorithms 
for performing a conflict-free minimum-spanning tree broadcast, a pipelined algorithm that is similar to 
Ho and Johnsson's EDST algorithm for hypercubes, and a novel scatter-collect approach that is a natural 
choice for communication libraries due to its simplicity. Results obtained on the Intel Paragon system 
are included.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, we introduce a new parallel library effort, as part of the PLAPACK 
project, that attempts to address discrepencies between the needs of applications and 
parallel libraries. A number of contributions are made, including a new approach 
to matrix distribution, new insights into layering parallel linear algebra libraries, and 
the application of "object based" programming techniques which have recently become 
popular for (parallel) scientific libraries. We present an overview of a prototype library, 
the SL Library, which incorporates these ideas. Preliminary performance data shows 
this more application-centric approach to libraries does not necessarily adversely impact 
performance, compared to more traditional approaches.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents a new system, called NetSolve, that allows users to access computational resources, such as hardware and software, distributed across the network. The development of NetSolve 
was motivated by the need for an easy-to-use, efficient mechanism for using computational resources remotely. Ease of use is obtained as a result of different interfaces, some of which require no programming 
effort from the user. Good performance is ensured by a load-balancing policy that enables NetSolve to 
use the computational resources available as efficiently as possible. NetSolve offers the ability to look 
for computational resources on a network, choose the best one available, solve a problem (with retry for 
fault-tolerance), and return the answer to the user.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a definition of goal achievability: given a basic action theory describing an initial state of the world and some primitive actions available to a 
robot, including some actions which return binary sensing information, what goals can 
be achieved by the robot? The main technical result of the paper is a proof that a simple 
robot programming language is universal, in that any effectively achievable goal can be 
achieved by getting the robot to execute one of the robot programs. The significance of 
this result is at least two fold. First, it is in many ways similar to the equivalence theorem between Turing machines and recursive functions, but applied to robots whose 
actions are specified by an action theory. Secondly, it provides formal justifications for 
using the simple robot programming language as a foundation for our work on robotics.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
One way to think about STRIPS is as a mapping from databases to databases, in the following sense: Suppose we want to know what 
the world would be like if an action, represented by the STRIPS operator ff, were done 
in some world, represented by the STRIPS 
database D 0 . To find out, simply perform 
the operator ff on D 0 (by applying ff's elementary add and delete revision operators to 
D 0 ). We describe this process as progressing 
the database D 0 in response to the action ff. 
In this paper, we consider the general problem of progressing an initial database in response to a given sequence of actions. We 
appeal to the situation calculus and an axiomatization of actions which addresses the 
frame problem (Reiter [13], Lin and Reiter 
[8]). This setting is considerably more general than STRIPS. Our results concerning 
progression are mixed. The (surprising) bad 
news is that, in general, to characterize a progressed database we must appeal to second 
order logic. The good news is that there are 
many useful special cases for which we can 
compute the progressed database in first order logic; not only that, we can do so efficiently.  </abstract>

The rectilinear Steiner tree problem requires a shortest tree spanning a given vertex subset

72 1:347 of the optimal length, 
respectively. It was claimed that these bounds are not tight. Here we improve these bounds to 
1.3125 and 61 
48 1:271, respectively, and give efficient algorithms to find approximations of such 
quality. We also prove that for Zelikovsky's heuristic this bound cannot be less than 1.3.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Recent attempts at incorporating concurrency into functional languages have 
identified synchronous communication via shared channels as a promising primitive. An additional useful feature found in many proposals is a nondeterministic 
choice operator. Similar in nature to the CSP alternative command, this operator 
allows different possible actions to be guarded by sends or receives. Choice is 
difficult to implement in a distributed environment because it requires offering 
many potential communications but closing only one. In this paper we present 
the first distributed, deadlock-free algorithm for choice.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit helps programmers write applications that process machine code. 
Applications that use the toolkit are written at an 
assembly-language level of abstraction, but they recognize and emit binary. Guided by a short instruction-set specification, the toolkit generates all the bit-manipulating code. 
The toolkit's specification language uses four concepts: fields and tokens describe parts of instructions, 
patterns describe binary encodings of instructions or 
groups of instructions, and constructors map between 
the assembly-language and binary levels. These concepts are suitable for describing both CISC and RISC 
machines; we have written specifications for the MIPS 
R3000, SPARC, and Intel 486 instruction sets. 
We have used the toolkit to help write two applications: a debugger and a linker. The toolkit generates 
efficient code; for example, the linker emits binary up 
to 15% faster than it emits assembly language, making 
it 1.7-2 times faster to produce an a.out directly than 
by using the assembler.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
An implicit premise of existing routing methods is that the routing topology must correspond to a 
tree (i.e., it does not contain cycles). In this paper we investigate the consequences of abandoning this 
basic axiom, and instead we allow routing topologies that correspond to arbitrary graphs (i.e., where 
cycles are allowed). We show that non-tree routing can significantly improve signal propagation delay, 
reduce signal skew, and afford increased reliability with respect to open faults that may be caused by 
manufacturing defects and electro-migration. Simulations on uniformly-distributed nets indicate that 
depending on net size and technology parameters, our non-tree routing construction reduces maximum 
sourse-sink SPICE delay by an average of up to 62%, and reduces signal skew by an average of up to 
63%, as compared with Steiner routing. Moreover, up to 77% of the total wirelength in non-trees can 
tolerate an open fault without disconnecting the circuit.  </abstract>

Several cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessors have been 
developed that are scalable and offer a very tight coupling between 
the processing resources. They are therefore quite attractive for 
use as compute servers for multiprogramming and parallel application workloads. Process scheduling and memory management, 
however, remain challenging due to the distributed main memory found on such machines. This paper examines the effects of 
OS scheduling and page migration policies on the performance 
of such compute servers. Our experiments are done on the Stan-ford DASH, a distributed-memory cache-coherent multiprocessor. 
We show that for our multiprogramming workloads consisting of 
sequential jobs, the traditional Unix scheduling policy does very 
poorly. In contrast, a policy incorporating cluster and cache affinity along with a simple page-migration algorithm offers up to twofold performance improvement. For our workloads consisting of 
multiple parallel applications, we compare space-sharing policies 
that divide the processors among the applications to time-slicing 
policies such as standard Unix or gang scheduling. We show 
that space-sharing policies can achieve better processor utilization 
due to the operating point effect, but time-slicing policies benefit 
strongly from user-level data distribution. Our initial experience 
with automatic page migration suggests that policies based only 
on TLB miss information can be quite effective, and useful for 
addressing the data distribution problems of space-sharing sched-ulers.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Semantic query optimization refers to the process of using 
integrity constraints (ic's) in order to optimize the evaluation 
of queries. The process is well understood in the case 
of unions of select-project-join queries (i.e., nonrecursive 
datalog). For arbitrary datalog programs, however, the 
issue has largely remained an unsolved problem. This 
paper studies this problem and shows when semantic query 
optimization can be completely done in recursive rules 
provided that order constraints and negated EDB subgoals 
appear only in the recursive rules, but not in the ic's. 
If either order constraints or negated EDB subgoals are 
introduced in ic's, then the problem of semantic query 
optimization becomes undecidable. Since semantic query 
optimization is closely related to the containment problem 
of a datalog program in a union of conjunctive queries, our 
results also imply new decidability and undecidability results 
for that problem when order constraints and negated EDB 
subgoals are used.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Though the C preprocessor provides necessary language features, it does so in an unstructured way. The lexical nature of cpp creates numerous problems for software engineers 
and their tools, all stemming from the chasm between the engineer's view of the source code 
and the compiler's view. The simplest way to reduce this problem is to minimize use of the 
preprocessor. In light of the data collected in a prior empirical analysis, this paper describes 
a tool to aid the software engineer in analyses targeted at replacing preprocessor constructs 
with language features. Existing tools for analyzing C source in the context of the preprocessor are unsuitable for such transformations. This work introduces a new approach: tightly 
integrating the preprocessor with a C language parser, permitting the code to be analyzed at 
both the preprocessor and syntactic levels simultaneously. The front-end framework, called 
PCp 3 , combines a preprocessor, a parser, and arbitrary Perl subroutine "hooks" invoked upon 
various preprocessor and parser events. PCp 3 's strengths and weaknesses are discussed in the 
context of several program understanding and transformation tools, including a conservative 
analysis to support replacing cpp's #define directives with C++ language features.  </abstract>

<title> Effective Cache Prefetching on Bus-Based Multiprocessors  </title>
<author> Dean M. Tullsen and Susan J. Eggers  </author>
<affiliation> University of Washington  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
Compiler-directed cache prefetching has the potential to hide much of the high memory latency seen by 
current and future high-performance processors. However, prefetching is not without costs, particularly on a 
multiprocessor. Prefetching can negatively affect bus utilization, overall cache miss rates, memory latencies and 
data sharing. 
We simulate the effects of a compiler-directed prefetching algorithm, running on a range of bus-based multiprocessors. We show that, despite a high memory latency, this architecture does not necessarily support prefetching 
well, in some cases actually causing performance degradations. We pinpoint several problems with prefetching on 
a shared memory architecture (additional conflict misses, no reduction in the data sharing traffic and associated 
latencies, a multiprocessor's greater sensitivity to memory utilization and the sensitivity of the cache hit rate to 
prefetch distance) and measure their effect on performance. We then solve those problems through architectural 
techniques and heuristics for prefetching that could be easily incorporated into a compiler: 1) victim caching, 
which eliminates most of the cache conflict misses caused by prefetching in a direct-mapped cache, 2) special 
prefetch algorithms for shared data, which significantly improve the ability of our basic prefetching algorithm 
to prefetch invalidation misses, and 3) compiler-based shared data restructuring, which eliminates many of the 
invalidation misses the basic prefetching algorithm doesn't predict. The combined effect of these improvements 
is to make prefetching effective over a much wider range of memory architectures.  </abstract>

Language Analysis Using Artificial Neural Networks  </title>

<abstract> Abstract 
Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based 
on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there 
has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current 
spoken-language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or 
symbolic semantic component. 
In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing 
of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, 
semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we 
use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and 
language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist 
networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the screen system which is 
based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. 
In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of screen's architecture, the flat 
syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed 
evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. 
The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of 
spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we 
show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support 
a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall 
hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the 
system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the 
interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of 
a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, 
such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, 
we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form 
(NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic 
algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We 
show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size 
consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences 
and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm 
that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is 
shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies 
some general conditions.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes PBSM (Partition Based Spatial-Merge), a new algorithm for performing spatial join operation. This algorithm is especially effective when neither of the inputs to the join have an index on the joining 
attribute. Such a situation could arise if both inputs to the join are intermediate results in a complex query, or in 
a parallel environment where the inputs must be dynamically redistributed. The PBSM algorithm partitions the 
inputs into manageable chunks, and joins them using a computational geometry based plane-sweeping technique. This paper also presents a performance study comparing the the traditional indexed nested loops join 
algorithm, a spatial join algorithm based on joining spatial indices, and the PBSM algorithm. These comparisons 
are based on complete implementations of these algorithms in Paradise, a database system for handling GIS applications. Using real data sets, the performance study examines the behavior of these spatial join algorithms in a 
variety of situations, including the cases when both, one, or none of the inputs to the join have an suitable index. 
The study also examines the effect of clustering the join inputs on the performance of these join algorithms. The 
performance comparisons demonstrates the feasibility, and applicability of the PBSM join algorithm.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
An exhaustive dataflow-analysis algorithm associates with each point in a program a set of dataflow facts 
that are guaranteed to hold whenever that point is reached during program execution. By contrast, a 
demand dataflow-analysis algorithm determines whether a single given dataflow fact holds at a single given 
point. 
This paper presents a new demand algorithm for interprocedural dataflow analysis. The algorithm has 
four important properties: 
g It provides precise (meet-over-all-interprocedurally-valid-paths) solutions to a large class of problems. 
g It has a polynomial worst-case cost for both a single demand and a sequence of all possible demands. 
g The worst-case total cost of the sequence of all possible demands is no worse than the worst-case cost 
of a single run of the current best exhaustive algorithm. 
g Experimental results show that in many situations (e.g., when only a small number of demands are 
made, or when most demands are answered yes) the demand algorithm is superior to the current best 
exhaustive algorithm.  </abstract>

<title> Maximal-Munch Tokenization in Linear Time  </title>
<author> THOMAS REPS  </author>
<affiliation> University of Wisconsin  </affiliation>
<abstract> The lexical-analysis (or scanning) phase of a compiler attempts to partition the input stream into a sequence of tokens. 
The convention in most languages is that the input is scanned left to right, and each token identified is a maximal 
munch of the remaining inputthe longest prefix of the remaining input that is a token of the language. Most textbooks on compiling have extensive discussions of lexical analysis in terms of finite-state automata and regular expressions: Token classes are defined by a set of regular expressions R i , 1 i k, and the lexical analyzer is based on some 
form of finite-state automaton for recognizing the language L (R 1 + R 2 + . . . + R k ). However, the treatment is unsatisfactory in one respect: The theory of finite-state automata assumes that the end of the input stringi.e., the right-hand-side boundary of the candidate for recognitionis known a priori, whereas a scanner must identify the next token 
without knowing a definite bound on the extent of the token. 
Although most of the standard compiler textbooks discuss this issue, the solution they sketch out is one thatfor 
certain sets of token definitionscan cause the scanner to exhibit quadratic behavior in the worst case. This property is 
not only dissatisfying, it blemishes an otherwise elegant treatment of lexical analysis. 
In this paper, we rectify this defect: We show that, given a deterministic finite-state automaton that recognizes the 
tokens of a language, maximal-munch tokenization can always be performed in time linear in the size of the input.  </abstract>

DEVise is a data exploration system that allows users to easily develop, browse, and share visual presentations of large 
tabular datasets (possibly containing or referencing multimedia objects) from several sources. The DEVise framework 
is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number

Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be 
easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations 
that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its 
greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a 
visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to 
seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local 
and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise 
framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We examine the effects of latent variables, between 
individual variability and measurement error in the 
outcome on commonly used methods for the analysis of longitudinal ordinal data, such as marginal 
and cluster-specific models. The impact of such variability becomes very clear when viewed in the context of structural equation modeling (e.g. Muthen 
1979, 1983, 1984, 1988). The structural equation 
formulation also provides insight into the assumptions and differences in interpretation of regression 
coefficients of these various methods of analysis. We 
explore the potential for using structural equations 
to model random effects and to adjust for measurement error, and in the process compare results 
from marginal modeling using a SAS GEE routine 
(Karim and Zeger, 1988), Qu's GAUSS program 
(Qu, 1992) for generalized mixed models using GEE, 
the MIXOR package for cluster-specific mixed effects models (Hedeker and Gibbons, 1994), and LIS-COMP (Muthen, 1988) for structural equation models. These approaches are illustrated in a longitudinal data set of sleep disorders.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The techniques which are used to implement interprocedural data flow analyzers can be generally 
divided into two parts: the call string and the functional approach [18]. Both differ in their time and space 
complexity as well as in the preciseness due to properties of the abstract domains and transfer functions. 
We have developed a data flow analyzer generator PAG [2] which is able to produce interprocedural 
analyzers for both techniques. We specified two variants of constant propagation working in an ANSI-C 
compiler; a copy constant propagation that uses distributive transfer function and can be solved precisely, 
even interprocedurally [13], and a full constant propagator which includes an interpreter for expressions 
of the language. We present the practical relevant results applying both analyzers to a rather fair set of 
real-world programs and compare the space/time consumption of the analyzers versus their preciseness.  </abstract>

Kerberos to achieve authentication. It also describes the management and replication of 
the database required. The views of Kerberos as seen by the user, programmer, and 
administrator are described. Finally, the role of Kerberos in the larger Athena picture is 
given, along with a list of applications that presently use Kerberos for user authentication. We describe the addition of Kerberos authentication to the Sun Network File System as a case study for integrating Kerberos with an existing application.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The complexity of parallel applications and parallel processor scheduling policies makes both exact analysis and simulation difficult, if not intractable, for large systems. In this paper we propose a new approach 
to performance modeling of multiprogrammed processor scheduling policies, that of interpolation approximations. We first define a workload model that contains parameters for the essential properties of parallel 
applications with respect to scheduling discipline performance, yet lends itself to mathematical analysis. Key 
features of the workload model include general distribution of total job processing time, general distribution 
of available job parallelism, and a simple characterization of parallelism overheads. We then show that one 
can find specific values of the system parameters for which the parallel system under a given scheduling 
policy reduces to a queueing system with a known (closed-form) solution. Finally, interpolation between 
the points with known solutions is used to arrive at mean response time estimates that hold over the entire 
system parameter space. The interpolation approximations readily yield insight into policy behavior and are 
easy to evaluate for systems with hundreds of processors. 
We illustrate the approach by developing and validating models of three scheduling policies, under the 
assumptions of linear job execution rates and independence between job parallelism and processing time. 
We discuss several insights and results obtained from the analysis of the three policies under the assumed 
workloads. One result clarifies and generalizes observations in two previous simulation studies of how policy 
performance varies with the coefficient of variation in job processing requirement. Another result of the 
interpolation models yields new insight into how policy performance varies with job parallelism. We also 
comment on the generalizations of these insights for workloads with less restrictive assumptions.  </abstract>

backward differencing formulas. The schemes use non-staggered grids and satisfy regularity estimates, guaranteeing smoothness of the solutions. The schemes are computationally 
efficient. Computational results demonstrating the accuracy are presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The performance potential of run-to-completion (RTC) parallel 
processor scheduling policies is investigated by examining 
whether (1) application execution rate characteristics such as average parallelism (avg) and processor working set (pws) and/or (2) 
limited preemption can be used to improve the performance of 
these policies. We address the first question by comparing policies 
(previous as well as new) that differ only in whether or not they 
use execution rate characteristics and by examining a wider range 
of the workload parameter space than previous studies. We address 
the second question by comparing a simple two-level queueing 
policy with RTC scheduling in the second level queue against 
RTC policies that don't allow any preemption and against dynamic 
equiallocation (EQ). 
Using simulation to estimate mean response times we find that for 
promising RTC policies such as adaptive static partitioning (ASP) 
and shortest demand first (SDF), a maximum allocation constraint 
that is for all practical purposes independent of avg and pws provides greater and more consistent improvement in policy performance than using avg or pws. Also, under the assumption that job 
demand information is unavailable to the scheduler we show that 
the ASP-max policy outperforms all previous high performance 
RTC policies for workloads with coefficient of variation in processing requirement greater than one. Furthermore, a two-level 
queue that allows at most one preemption per job outperforms 
ASP-max but is not competitive with EQ.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely used in lossy image and video compression schemes 
such as JPEG and MPEG. In this paper we describe RD-OPT, an efficient algorithm for constructing 
DCT quantization tables with optimal rate-distortion tradeoffs for a given image. The algorithm uses 
DCT coefficient distribution statistics in a novel way and uses a dynamic programming strategy to 
produce optimal quantization tables over a wide range of rates and distortions. It can be used to 
compress images at any desired signal-to-noise ratio or compressed size.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We consider the problem of software generalization: Given a program component C, create 
a parameterized program component C 0 such that C 0 is usable in a wider variety of syntactic 
contexts than C. Furthermore, C 0 should be a semantically meaningful generalization of C; 
namely, there must exist an instantiation of C 0 that is equivalent in functionality to C. 
In this paper, we present an algorithm that generalizes C functions via type inference. The 
original functions operate on specific data types; the result of generalization is a collection of 
C++ function templates that operate on parameterized types. This version of the generalization 
problem is useful in the context of converting existing C programs to C++.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We show the interconvertibility of context-free-language reachability problems and a class 
of set-constraint problems: given a context-free-language reachability problem, we show how to 
construct a set-constraint problem whose answer gives a solution to the reachability problem; 
given a set-constraint problem, we show how to construct a context-free-language reachability 
problem whose answer gives a solution to the set-constraint problem. The interconvertibility 
of these two formalisms offers an conceptual advantage akin to the advantage gained from the 
interconvertibility of finite-state automata and regular expressions in language theory, namely, 
a problem can be formulated in whichever formalism is most natural. It also offers some insight into the "O(n 3 ) bottleneck" for different types of program-analysis problems, and allows 
results previously obtained for context-free-language reachability problems to be applied to set 
constraint problems.  </abstract>

scale mixed complementarity problems. We discuss inadequacies in how solvers are currently 
compared, and present a testing environment that addresses these inadequacies. This testing 
environment consists of a library of test problems, along with GAMS and MATLAB interfaces that 
allow these problems to be easily accessed. The environment is intended for use as a tool by other 
researchers to better understand both their algorithms and their implementations, and to direct 
research toward problem classes that are currently the most challenging. As an initial benchmark, 
eight different algorithm implementations for large scale mixed complementarity problems are 
briefly described and tested with default parameter settings using the new testing environment.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Software engineering applications require sophisticated 
object management system support for creating and 
manipulating software objects. One of the key issues for 
object management systems is distribution. Addressing this issue in the context of software engineering applications is particularly challenging because they have 
widely varying object access profiles. Two fundamental 
approaches to dealing with distribution are the object 
server architecture, where objects are shipped to the 
application program, and the operation server architecture, where operation requests are shipped to where the 
objects reside. We compare these architectures experimentally to determine the conditions under which each 
performs better.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In order to analyze a program that involves pointers, it 
is necessary to have (safe) information about what each 
pointer points to. There are many different approaches 
to computing points-to information. This paper addresses techniques for flow- and context-insensitive in-terprocedural analysis of stack-based storage. 
The paper makes two contributions to work in this 
area: 
* The first contribution is a set of experiments that 
explore the trade-offs between techniques previously defined by Lars Andersen and Bjarne Steens-gaard. The former has a cubic worst-case running 
time, while the latter is essentially linear. However, the former may be much more precise than 
the latter. We have found that in practice, Ander-sen's algorithm is consistently more precise than 
Steensgaard's. For small programs, there is very 
little difference in the times required by the two 
approaches; however, for larger programs, Ander-sen's algorithm can be much slower than Steens 
gaard's. 
* The second contribution is the definition of two 
new algorithms. The first algorithm can be "tuned" 
so that its worst-case time and space requirements, 
as well as its accuracy range from those of Steens-gaard to those of Andersen. We have experimented 
with several versions of this algorithm; one version 
provided a significant increase in accuracy over 
Steensgaard's algorithm, while keeping the running time within a factor of two. 
The second algorithm uses the first as a subroutine. Its worst-case time and space requirements 
are a factor of log N (where N is the number of 
variables in the program) worse than those of 
Steensgaard's algorithm. In practice, it appears to  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
To speed up multidimensional data analysis, 
database systems frequently precompute aggregates on some subsets of dimensions and 
their corresponding hierarchies. This improves 
query response time. However, the decision of 
what and how much to precompute is a difficult one. It is further complicated by the fact 
that precomputation in the presence of hierarchies can result in an unintuitively large increase in the amount of storage required by the 
database. Hence, it is interesting and useful 
to estimate the storage blowup that will result from a proposed set of precomputations 
without actually computing them. We propose 
three strategies for this problem: one based on 
sampling, one based on mathematical approximation, and one based on probabilistic counting. We investigate the accuracy of these algorithms in estimating the blowup for different 
data distributions and database schemas. The 
algorithm based upon probabilistic counting is 
particularly attractive, since it estimates the 
storage blowup to within provable error bounds 
while performing only a single scan of the data.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
An important problem faced by many database management 
systems is the "online object placement problem"|the 
problem of choosing a disk page to hold a newly allocated 
object. In the absence of clustering criteria, the goal is 
to maximize storage utilization. For main-memory based 
systems, simple heuristics exist that provide reasonable 
space utilization in the worst case and excellent utilization 
in typical cases. However, the storage management problem 
for databases includes significant additional challenges, such 
as minimizing I/O traffic, coping with crash recovery, and 
gracefully integrating space management with locking and 
logging. 
We survey several object placement algorithms, including 
techniques that can be found in commercial and research 
database systems. We then present a new object placement 
algorithm that we have designed for use in Shore, an 
object-oriented database system under development at the 
University of Wisconsin|Madison. Finally, we present 
results from a series of experiments involving actual Shore 
implementations of some of these algorithms. Our results 
show that while current object placement algorithms have 
serious performance deficiencies, including excessive CPU 
or main memory overhead, I/O traffic, or poor disk 
utilization, our new algorithm consistently demonstrates 
excellent performance in all of these areas.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A number of efficient learning algorithms achieve exact identification of an unknown function 
from some class using membership and equivalence queries. Using a standard transformation 
such algorithms can easily be converted to on-line learning algorithms that use membership 
queries. Under such a transformation the number of equivalence queries made by the query 
algorithm directly corresponds to the number of mistakes made by the on-line algorithm. In 
this paper we consider several of the natural classes known to be learnable in this setting, and 
investigate the minimum number of equivalence queries with accompanying counterexamples 
(or equivalently the minimum number of mistakes in the on-line model) that can be made by a 
learning algorithm that makes a polynomial number of membership queries and uses polynomial 
computation time. We are able both to reduce the number of equivalence queries used by the 
previous algorithms and often to prove matching lower bounds. As an example, consider the 
class of DNF formulas over n variables with at most k = O(log n) terms. Previously, the 
algorithm of Blum and Rudich [BR92] provided the best known upper bound of 2 O(k) log n for 
the minimum number of equivalence queries needed for exact identification. We greatly improve 
on this upper bound showing that exactly k counterexamples are needed if the learner knows k a 
priori and exactly k +1 counterexamples are needed if the learner does not know k a priori. This 
exactly matches known lower bounds [BC92]. For many of our results we obtain a complete 
characterization of the tradeoff between the number of membership and equivalence queries 
needed for exact identification. The classes we consider here are monotone DNF formulas, Horn 
sentences, O(log n)-term DNF formulas, read-k sat-j DNF formulas, read-once formulas over 
various bases, and deterministic finite automata.  </abstract>

<author> Saied Hosseini-Khayat and Jerome R. Cox, Jr.  </author>
<affiliation> Washington University in St. Louis  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract. Network traffic can be reduced significantly if caching is utilized effectively. As an effort 
in this direction we study the replacement problem 
that arises in caching of multimedia objects. The size 
of objects and the cost of cache misses are assumed 
non-uniform. The non-uniformity of size is inherent in multimedia objects, and the non-uniformity of 
cost is due to the non-uniformity of size and the fact 
that the objects are scattered throughout the network. 
Although a special case of this problem, i.e. the case 
of uniform size and cost, has been extensively studied, the general case needs a great deal of study. We 
present a dynamic programming method of optimally 
solving the off-line and on-line versions of this problem, and discuss the complexity of this method.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
High-performance Web servers are essential to meet the growing demands of the Internet and large-scale intranets. Satisfying these demands requires a thorough understanding of key 
factors affecting Web server performance. This paper presents 
empirical analysis illustrating how dynamic and static adaptivity can enhance Web server performance. Two research 
contributions support this conclusion. 
First, the paper presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of Web servers (such as Apache, Netscape Enterprise, PHTTPD, Zeus, and JAWS) over high-speed ATM networks. This study illustrates their relative performance and 
precisely pinpoints the server design choices that cause performance bottlenecks. We found that once network and disk 
I/O overheads are reduced to negligible constant factors, the 
main determinants of Web server performance are its protocol processing path and concurrency strategy. Moreover, no 
single strategy performs optimally for all load conditions and 
traffic types. 
Second, we describe the design techniques and optimizations used to develop JAWS, our high-performance, adaptive 
Web server. JAWS is an object-oriented Web server that was 
explicitly designed to alleviate the performance bottlenecks 
we identified in existing Web servers. It consistently outperforms all other Web servers over ATM networks. The performance optimizations used in JAWS include adaptive pre-spawned threading, fixed headers, cached date processing, 
and file caching. In addition, JAWS uses a novel software architecture that substantially improves its portability and flex

illustrate that highly efficient communication software is not

<abstract> Abstract 
Conventional implementations of communication middle-ware (such as CORBA and traditional RPC toolkits) incur 
considerable overhead when used for performance-sensitive 
applications over high-speed networks. As gigabit networks 
become pervasive, inefficient middleware will force programmers to use lower-level mechanisms to achieve the necessary 
transfer rates. This is a serious problem for mission/life-critical applications (such as satellite surveillance and medical imaging). 
This paper compares the performance of several widely 
used communication middleware mechanisms on a high-speed ATM network. The middleware ranged from lower-level mechanisms (such as socket-based C interfaces and 
C++ wrappers for sockets) to higher-level mechanisms (such 
as RPC, hand-optimized RPC and two implementations of 
CORBA - Orbix 2.0.1 and ORBeline 2.0). These measurements reveal that the lower-level C and C++ implementations outperform the CORBA implementations significantly 
(the best CORBA throughput for remote transfer was roughly 
75 to 80 percent of the best C/C++ throughput for sending scalar data types and only around 33 percent for sending structs containing binary fields), and the hand-optimized 
RPC code performs slightly better than the CORBA implementations. Our goal in precisely pinpointing the sources of 
overhead for communication middleware is to develop scalable and flexible CORBA implementations that can deliver 
gigabit data rates to applications.  </abstract>

ALGORITHMS IN TWO DIMENSIONS   </title>
<author> CRAIG C. DOUGLAS   </author>
<abstract> Abstract. Computers today rely heavily on good utilization of their cache memory subsystems. 
Compilers are optimized for business applications, not scientific computing ones, however. Automatic 
tiling of basic numerical algorithms is simply not provided by any compiler. Thus, absolutely terrible 
cache performance is normal for scientific computing applications. 
Multigrid algorithms combine several numerical algorithms into a more complicated algorithm. 
In this paper, an algorithm is derived that allows for data to pass through cache exactly once per 
multigrid level during a V cycle before the level changes. This is optimal cache usage for large 
problems that do not fit entirely in cache. 
The new algorithm would appear to be quite complicated to implement, leading to spaghetti 
coding. Actually, an efficient implementation of the algorithm requires a rigid, highly structured 
coding style. A coding example is given that is suitable for almost all common discretization methods. 
Numerical experiments are provided that show that the new algorithm is up to an integer factor 
faster than the traditional implementation method for common multigrid parameter choices.  </abstract>

<title> THE DOMAIN REDUCTION METHOD: HIGH WAY REDUCTION 
IN THREE DIMENSIONS AND CONVERGENCE WITH INEXACT 
SOLVERS   </title>
<author> CRAIG C. DOUGLAS AND JAN MANDEL   </author>
<abstract> Abstract. We study a method for parallel solution of elliptic partial differential equations which 
decomposes the problem into a number of independent subproblems on subspaces of the underlying 
solution space. Using symmetries of the domain, we obtain up to 64 such subproblems for a 3 
dimensional cube and the method reduces to a direct solver. In the general case, or when the 
subproblems are solved only approximately, the method becomes an iterative method or can be used 
as a preconditioner. Bounds on the resulting convergence factors and condition numbers are given.  </abstract>

<title> GEMMW: A PORTABLE LEVEL 3 BLAS WINOGRAD VARIANT OF

<author> CRAIG C. DOUGLAS , MICHAEL HEROUX , GORDON SLISHMAN x AND ROGER M. 
SMITH -  </author>
<abstract> Abstract. Matrix-matrix multiplication is normally computed using one of the BLAS or a 
reinvention of part of the BLAS. Unfortunately, the BLAS were designed with small matrices in 
mind. When huge, well conditioned matrices are multiplied together, the BLAS perform like the 
blahs, even on vector machines. For matrices where the coefficients are well conditioned, Winograd's 
variant of Strassen's algorithm offers some relief, but is rarely available in a quality form on most 
computers. We reconsider this method and offer a highly portable solution based on the Level 3 
BLAS interface.  </abstract>

<title> Constructing Logic Programs with

<author> Andreas Hamfelt  </author>
<affiliation> Computing Science Department

<abstract> Abstract: This paper proposes a logic programming approach based on the 
application of a system of higher-order predicates put at disposal within ordinary logic programming languages such as prolog. These higher-order 
predicates parallel the higher-order functionals or combinators which form an 
established part of contemporary functional programming methodology. 
The suggested toolbox of higher-order predicates for composing logic programs 
is derived from one universal higher-order predicate. They take the form of 
recursion operators (in particular for expressing recursion along lists) intended 
to cover all commonly occurring recursion schemes in logic programming practice. Their theoretical sufficiency is proved and their practical adequacy is 
argued through examples. 
The recursion operators, denoting higher-order relations rather than functions, are brought about straightforwardly through a well-known metalogic 
programming technique, rendering superfluous the need for special higher-order unification mechanisms.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we present co-transformation, a novel approach to the mapping of execution information from the 
source code of a program to the object code for the purpose of worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis. Our 
approach is designed to handle the problems introduced by 
optimizing compilers, i.e. that the structure of the object 
code is very different from the structure of the source code. 
The co-transformer allows us to keep track of how different compiler transformations, including optimizations, influence the execution time of a program. This allows us to 
statically calculate the execution time of a program at the 
object code level, using information about the program execution obtained at the source code level.  </abstract>

<title> Experience with MPI: 'Converting

<date> June 1995  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
This looks at the issues which arose in porting the pvmmake utility 
from PVM to MPI. Pvmmake is a PVM application which allows 
a user to send files, execute commands, and receive results from a 
single machine on any machine in the virtual machine. Its actions are 
controlled by the contents of a configuration file. Its most common 
use is to enable management of the development of a parallel program 
in a heterogeneous environment. A utility with the same features, 
mpimake, was coded up to run under LAM. 
Genetic programming is an algorithm which evolves an algorithm 
in the form of a program to solve your input problem. The implementation under MPI requires the transfer of dynamic data structures 
such as lists and trees. This paper discusses the match between the 
requirements of this algorithm and the datatype feature in MPI. A 
new library, MPI DataStruct is being developed which can transfer 
dynamic data structures, created with pointers, without intervention 
by the user.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. In the modern Internet environment, various types of 
data sources have become accessible, including multimedia data and web 
pages. Some of the fundamental assumptions in traditional databases, 
such as the existence of a global schema and data consistency maintained 
by a Data Base Administrator, are no longer true in many of the new 
data sources. We outline the DIOM [LP95b] object-oriented approach 
to build interoperable heterogeneous information systems despite the 
absence of global schema and the presence of data inconsistency. We describe the metadata catalog management component of DIOM, a key service in the support for interoperation among heterogeneous information 
sources. To support a flexible and customizable conection between information consumers and information producers, DIOM metadata catalog 
development utilizes the adaptive specification mechanisms, provided in 
DIOM interface description language, for explicit description of information consumers' domain query requirements and for object-oriented 
abstractions of information producers' information sources.  </abstract>

<pubnum> Technical report UCLA-CSD-950033  </pubnum>
<abstract> Abstract 
Optimistic replication is often viewed as essential for 
large scale systems and for supporting mobile computing. In optimistic replication, updates can be made concurrently to different file replicas, resulting in multiple 
versions of the file. To recover from these conflicting 
updates, after-the fact conflict resolution actions are 
required to recombine multiple versions into one. This 
paper defines these concepts and discusses approaches 
to measure them in optimistically replicated systems. 
Measurement of the number of conflicting updates 
and conflict resolution is important to judge the practicality of optimistic replication. An environment 
where conflicting updates are frequent will not be attractive since users cannot assume they have up-to-date 
data. Although many conflicts can be automatically 
resolved, some conflicts require user intervention; such 
conflicts cannot be too common. This paper shows an 
approach to measure the number of conflicting updates. 
From this measurement we derive the actual amount of 
work done by the user or system to resolve conflicts 
and the minimum amount of work required to resolve 
conflicts.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. We present a technique to study relations between weak and 
strong fi-normalisations in various typed -calculi. We first introduce a 
translation which translates a -term into a I-term, and show that a 
-term is strongly fi-normalisable if and only if its translation is weakly 
fi-normalisable. We then prove that the translation preserves typability 
of -terms in various typed -calculi. This enables us to establish the 
equivalence between weak and strong fi-normalisations in these typed 
-calculi. This translation can deal with Curry typing as well as Church 
typing, strengthening some recent closely related results. This may bring 
some insights into answering whether weak and strong fi-normalisations 
in all pure type systems are equivalent.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper describes work on the linguistic 
analysis of texts within a project devoted to 
knowledge acquisition from text. We focus 
on syntactic processing and present some 
key elements of the projects parser that 
allow it to deal successfully with technical 
texts. The parser is fully implemented and 
tested on a variety of real texts; 
improvements and enhancements are in 
progress. Because our knowledge acquisition 
method assumes no a priori model of the 
domain of the source text, the parser relies 
as much as possible on lexical and syntactic 
clues. That is why it strives for full 
syntactic analysis rather than some form of 
text skimming. We present a practical 
approach to four acknowledged difficult 
problems which to date have no generally 
acceptable answers: phrase attachment; time 
constraints for problematic input (how to 
avoid long and unproductive computation); 
parsing conjoined structures (how to 
preserve broad coverage without losing 
control of the parsing process); and the 
treatment of fragmentary input or fragments 
that are a byproduct of a fallback parsing 
strategy. We review recent related work and 
conclude by listing several future work 
items.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In the verification of cryptographic protocols along the 
approach of the logic for authentication by Burrows, 
Abadi, and Needham, it is possible to write a specification which does not faithfully represent the real world 
situation. Such a specification, though impossible or 
unreasonable to implement, can go undetected and be 
verified to be correct. It can also lead to logical statements that do not preserve causality, which in turn can 
have undesirable consequences. Such a specification, 
called an infeasible specification here, can be subtle and 
hard to locate. This note shows how the logic of cryptographic protocols by Gong, Needham, and Yahalom 
can be enhanced with a notion of eligibility to preserve 
causality of beliefs and detect infeasible specifications. 
It is conceivable that this technique can be adopted in 
other similar logics.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A distributed security architecture is proposed for 
incorporation into group oriented distributed systems, 
and in particular, into the Isis distributed programming toolkit. The primary goal of the architecture is 
to make common group oriented abstractions robust 
in hostile settings, in order to facilitate the construction of high performance distributed applications that 
can tolerate both component failures and malicious attacks. These abstractions include process groups and 
causal group multicast. Moreover, a delegation and 
access control scheme is proposed for use in group 
oriented systems. The focus of the paper is the security architecture; particular cryptosystems and key 
exchange protocols are not emphasized.  </abstract>

We propose a formal policy framework of MAC policies in multilevel relational databases. 
We identify the important components of such policies and their desirable properties. The 
framework provides a basis for systematically specifying such policies and characterizing 
their potential mismatches. Based on the framework, we compare and unify the MAC 
policies and policy components that are proposed in the literature or imposed in existing 
systems. Our framework could be used to capture and resolve MAC policy mismatches in 
the trusted interoperation of heterogeneous multilevel relational databases.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper first gives an overview of standard PROLOG indexing and 
then shows, in a step-by-step manner, how it can be improved by slightly 
extending the WAM indexing instruction set to allow indexing on multiple 
arguments. Heuristics are described that overcome the difficulty of computing the indexing WAM code. In order to become independent from a 
concrete WAM instruction set, an abstract graphical representation based 
on DAGs (called DAXes) is introduced. 
The paper includes a COMMON LISP listing of the main heuristics 
implemented; the algorithms were developed for RELFUN, a relational-plus-functional language, but can easily be used in arbitrary PROLOG 
implementations.  </abstract>

integrates essential declarative constructs: logic variables and non-determinism from the relational paradigm with nested and higher-order operations from the functional paradigm. Operator definitions use 
`valued clauses', subsuming relational Horn clauses and functional 
(conditional or unconditional) directed equations. Their semantics complements the atoms in relational Herbrand models by `molecules', which 
pair functions, applied to argument terms, with returned-value terms. 
All abstract notions are illustrated by concrete declarative programs.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
As semiconductor technology enters the deep submicron era, reliability has 
become a major challenge in the design and manufacturing of next generation 
VLSI circuits. In this paper we focus on one reliability issue the antenna 
effect in the context of 3-layer channel routing. We first present an antenna effect model in 3-layer channel routing and, based on this, an antenna effect cost 
function is proposed. A layer reassignment approach is adopted to minimize this 
cost function and we show that the layer reassignment problem can be formulated as a network bipartitioning problem. Experimental results show that the 
antenna effect can be reduced considerably by applying the proposed technique. 
Compared with previous work, one advantage of our approach is that no extra 
channel area is required for antenna effect minimization. We show that layer 
reassignment technique can be used in yield-related critical area minimization 
in 3-layer channel routing as well. The trade-off between these two objectives is 
also presented.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Crosstalk has become a major issue in VLSI design due to the high frequency, long 
interconnecting lines and small spacing between interconnects in today's integrated circuits. 
In this paper, we study the problem of crosstalk minimization in 3-layer HVH channel 
routing. A heuristic algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track reassignment 
is presented. This algorithm can iteratively modify the layout so that the crosstalk in the 
channel is minimized. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce the 
crosstalk by an average of 16.4% on a set of benchmark examples.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Communication networks shared by selfish users are 
considered and modeled as noncooperative repeated 
games. Each user is interested only in optimizing its 
own performance by controlling the routing of its load. 
We investigate the existence of a NEP that achieves 
the system-wide optimal cost. The existence of a NEP 
that not only achieves the system-wide optimal cost but 
also yields a cost for each user no greater than its stage 
game NEP cost is shown for two-node multiple link networks. It is shown that more general networks where 
all users have the same source-destination pair have 
a NEP that achieves the minimum total system cost 
under a mild technical condition. It is shown general 
networks with users having multiple source-destination 
pairs don't necessarily have such an NEP.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We study the following problem: two agents Alice and Bob are connected to each other by independent discrete memoryless channels. They 
wish to generate common randomness by communicating interactively over 
the two channels. Assuming that Alice and Bob are allowed access to 
independent external random sources at rates (in bits per step of communication) of H A and H B , respectively, we show that they can generate common randomness at a rate of max f min [H A + H(W jQ); I(P ; V )] + 
min [H B + H(V jP ); I(Q; W )] g bits per step. Here, V is the channel from 
Alice to Bob, and W is the channel from Bob to Alice. The maximum 
is over all probability distributions P and Q on the input alphabets of V 
and W respectively. We also prove a strong converse which establishes the 
above rate as the highest attainable in this situation.  </abstract>

<title> TIME-FREQUENCY SIGNAL MODELS FOR MUSIC ANALYSIS, 
TRANSFORMATION, AND SYNTHESIS  </title>
<author> Michael Goodwin Martin Vetterli  </author>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
In signal analysis-synthesis, the analysis derives a set of parameters that the synthesis uses to reconstruct the original 
signal. In musical applications, this reconstruction should 
be perceptually accurate, and the parameterization should 
allow for such desirable signal modifications as time-scaling, 
pitch-shifting, and cross-synthesis; the analysis parameters 
should correspond to a signal model that is flexible enough 
to allow these transformations. Sinusoidal modeling meets 
this flexibility requirement, but has difficulty representing 
some salient features of musical signals such as attack transients and noiselike processes. In this paper, sinusoidal 
modeling is reviewed and some variations are proposed to 
account for its shortcomings; also, wavelet-based representations of musical signals are considered.  </abstract>

<title> Reactive Modules  </title>
<author> Rajeev Alur Thomas A. Henzinger   </author>
<abstract> Abstract. We present a formal model for concurrent systems. The model represents 
synchronous and asynchronous components in a uniform framework that supports compositional (assume-guarantee) and hierarchical (stepwise-refinement) design and verification. While synchronous models are based on a notion of atomic computation step, 
and asynchronous models remove that notion by introducing stuttering, our model is 
based on a flexible notion of what constitutes a computation step: by applying an abstraction operator to a system, arbitrarily many consecutive steps can be collapsed into 
a single step. The abstraction operator, which may turn an asynchronous system into a 
synchronous one, allows us to describe systems at various levels of temporal detail. For 
describing systems at various levels of spatial detail, we use a hiding operator that may 
turn a synchronous system into an asynchronous one. We illustrate the model with diverse examples from synchronous circuits, asynchronous shared-memory programs, and 
synchronous message-passing protocols.  </abstract>

<title> Capacity, Mutual Information, and Coding 
for Finite-State Markov Channels  </title>
<author> Andrea J. Goldsmith, Member, IEEE and Pravin P. Varaiya, Fellow, IEEE   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
The Finite-State Markov Channel (FSMC) is a discrete-time varying channel whose variation is determined by a finite-state Markov process. These channels have memory due to the 
Markov channel variation. We obtain the FSMC capacity as a function of the conditional channel 
state probability. We also show that for i.i.d. channel inputs, this conditional probability converges 
weakly, and the channel's mutual information is then a closed-form continuous function of the input 
distribution. 
We next consider coding for FSMCs. In general, the complexity of maximum-likelihood 
decoding grows exponentially with the channel memory length. Therefore, in practice, interleaving 
and memoryless channel codes are used. This technique results in some performance loss relative 
to the inherent capacity of channels with memory. We propose a maximum-likelihood decision-feedback decoder with complexity that is independent of the channel memory. We calculate the 
capacity and cutoff rate of our technique, and show that it preserves the capacity of certain FSMCs. 
We also compare the performance of the decision-feedback decoder with that of interleaving and 
memoryless channel coding on a fading channel with 4PSK modulation.  </abstract>

<title> What's Decidable about Hybrid Automata?  </title>
<author> Thomas A. Henzinger 2 Peter W. Kopke 2 Anuj Puri 3 Pravin Varaiya 3  </author>
<abstract> Abstract. Hybrid automata model systems with both 
digital and analog components, such as embedded control programs. Many verification tasks for such programs 
can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify the precise boundary between decidability and undecidability of the reachability 
problem for hybrid automata. 
On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE 
reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized 
whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based 
on a translation of an initialized rectangular automaton 
into a timed automaton that defines the same timed language. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic 
procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata. 
On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an 
undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove 
that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata with a single stopwatch.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Most caching schemes in wide-area, distributed systems are client-initiated. Decisions of when and 
where to cache information are made without the benefit of the server's global knowledge of the usage 
patterns. In this paper, we present a new caching strategy: geographical push-caching. Using the server's 
global knowledge and a derived network topology, we distribute data to cooperating servers. The World 
Wide Web is an example of a wide-area system that will benefit from distance-sensitive caching, and we 
present an architecture that allows a Web server to autonomously replicate HTML pages. We use a trace-driven simulation to evaluate several competing caching strategies. Our results show that geographical 
push-caching reduces bandwidth consumption and sever load by the same amount as web proxy caching, 
but with a savings in global cache space of almost two orders of magnitude. More importantly, servers 
that wish to reduce Internet bandwidth consumption and their load can do so without waiting for web 
proxies to be implemented world-wide. Furthermore, geographical push-caching helps distribute server 
load for all web servers, not just the most popular as is the case with proxy caching.  </abstract>

The objective of this paper is to develop models that 
characterize the communication performance of a message-passing multicomputer by taking the IBM SP2 as a case 
study. The paper evaluates and models the three aspects 
of the communication performance: scheduling overhead, 
message-passing time, and synchronization overhead. Performance models are developed for the basic communication patterns, enabling the estimation of the communication 
times of a message-passing application. Such estimates facilitate activities such as application tuning, selection of the 
best available implementation technique, and performance 
comparisons among different multicomputers.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Modulo scheduling algorithms based on optimal 
solvers have been proposed to investigate and tune the 
performance of modulo scheduling heuristics. While 
recent advances have broadened the scope for which 
the optimal approach is applicable, this approach 
increasingly suffers from large execution times. In this 
paper, we propose a more efficient formulation of the 
modulo scheduling space that significantly decreases 
the execution time of solvers based on integer linear 
programs. For example, the total execution time is 
reduced by a factor of 8.6 when 782 loops from the 
Perfect Club, SPEC, and Livermore Fortran Kernels 
are scheduled for minimum register requirements using 
the more efficient formulation instead of the traditional 
formulation. Experimental evidence further indicates 
that significantly larger loops can be scheduled under 
realistic machine constraints.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Most of the recent color recognition/indexing approaches concentrate on establishing invariance to illumination color to improve the utility of color recognition. However, other effects caused by illumination pose and specularity on three-dimensional 
object surfaces have not received notable attention. We present a chromaticity recognition method that discounts the effects of illumination pose, illumination color and 
specularity. It utilizes a chromaticity space based on log-ratio of sensor responses for 
illumination pose and color invariance. A model-based specularity detection/rejection 
algorithm can be used to improve the chromaticity recognition and illumination estimation for objects including specular reflections.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
As the use of the Internet for electronic commerce, audio 
and video conferencing, and other applications with sensitive content grows, the need for secure services becomes 
critical. Central to the success of these services is the support for secure public key distribution. Although there are 
several existing services available for this purpose, they 
are not very scalable, either because they depend on a centralized server or rely on ad hoc trust relationships. 
In this paper, we present and examine a flexible approach to certificate distribution scalable to arbitrarily 
large networks. We propose a two level hierarchy where 
certificates can be independently authenticated by one or 
more peer authorities, called keyservers. Certificates for 
end-user and host entities are managed within local domains, called enterprises. By administering certificates 
close to the source, we reduce the load on the key servers 
and the effects of network topology changes. We describe 
the design of our system and present a preliminary performance analysis based on traces of present-day DNS requests.  </abstract>

with disjunctive precondition, conditional effects and universal quantification over dynamic universes. Along the way we explain how 
Chapman's formulation of the Modal Truth Criterion is misleading 
and why his NP-completeness result for reasoning about plans with 
conditional effects does not apply to our planner.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Some of the advanced real-time systems being proposed, such as the Next Generation Workstation/Machine 
Controller (NGC) for automated factories, require a built-in database to support concurrent data access and provide 
well-defined interfaces between software modules. However, conventional database systems do not provide the performance levels or response time guarantees needed by real-time applications. To address the need for high-performance 
real-time database systems, we propose to design, implement, and evaluate an object-oriented software system called 
Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems (MDARTS). An important feature of MDARTS is that 
it supports explicit specification of real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an object-granularity level. 
The database examines these specifications at runtime during application initialization and dynamically adjusts 
its data management strategy accordingly to provide hard real-time guarantees. For maximum performance on 
shared-memory multiprocessors, MDARTS supports concurrent, direct, shared-memory data access. Prior real-time 
database systems do not support per-object dynamic configuration during initialization, and they either work only on 
uniprocessors or use relatively slow inter-process communication for all transactions. The unique design of MDARTS 
will support a transaction execution time two to three orders of magnitude faster than current real-time database 
systems for multiprocessors. For data access with less stringent timing constraints, MDARTS also supports remote 
transactions across networks and provides interfaces to external database systems. Once we have implemented the 
basic MDARTS architecture, we will demonstrate its capabilities by using it to develop distributed, open architecture 
controllers for actual manufacturing machine tools.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper examines the network inter-domain routing information exchanged between backbone service providers at 
the major U.S. public Internet exchange points. Internet 
routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reach-ability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network 
latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have lead to the loss of internal 
connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In this paper, 
we describe several unexpected trends in routing instability, 
and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the exchange of inter-domain routing information. 
The analysis in this paper is based on data collected from 
BGP routing messages generated by border routers at five 
of the Internet core's public exchange points during a nine 
month period. We show that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of magnitude more than expected and 
that the majority of this routing information is redundant, 
or pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several 
unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic properties in 
Internet routing. We finally posit a number of explanations 
for these anomalies and evaluate their potential impact on 
the Internet infrastructure.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Recovery from failures and erroneous executions is a crucial but complicated issue for concurrently accessed data systems. Increasingly sophisticated techniques are being developed to improve performance 
and functionality of recovery protocols. To better understand and analyze recovery schemes, we reexamine the concept of spheres of control [Dav78], using it as a unifying framework for specifying diverse 
recovery models simply and precisely. We constrain sphere-of-control formulations appropriately to capture transaction-oriented recovery in both centralized and distributed environments and with different 
types of schedules, as well as semantics-based recovery and compensation. In addition, we discuss how 
the operational semantics methodology of evolving algebras [Gur95] can model spheres of control formally 
and refine them to lower levels of abstraction.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents an hierarchical end-to-end 
analysis technique that decomposes the very complex 
heterogeneous multi-resource scheduling problem into 
a set of single resource scheduling problems with well 
defined interactions. We define heterogeneity both in 
resource types, e.g., CPU, and in scheduling policies, 
e.g., rate-monotonic scheduling. This analysis 
technique is one phase of our systems integration 
framework for designing large-scale, heterogeneous, 
distributed real-time systems whose timing properties 
can be strictly controlled and analyzed. This approach, 
denoted the Distributed Pipelining Framework, 
exploits the natural pipelining execution pattern found 
in a large number of continuous (periodic) applications 
executing over heterogenous resources. A teleconference application is used in this paper to show the 
utility of the approach.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The construction of rational agents is one of the goals that has been pursued in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). In most of the architectures that have been proposed for 
this kind of agents, its behaviour is guided by its set of beliefs. In our work, rational 
agents are those systems that are permanently engaged in the process of rational 
inquiry; thus, their beliefs keep evolving in time, as a consequence of their internal 
inference procedures and their interaction with the environment. Both AI researchers 
and philosophers are interested in having a formal model of this process, and this is 
the main topic in our work. 
Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The 
possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically 
omniscient and perfect reasoners. We avoid these problems by replacing possible 
worlds by conceivable situations, which are all the situations that the modelled agent 
is capable of considering. 
In this document we show how this notion of conceivable situations may be used 
to model the process of rational inquiry in which a non-ideal rational agent is engaged. We define a wide class of agents, called rational inquirers, which are a general 
abstraction of any kind of non-ideal agent. We show how the beliefs of these kind of 
agents evolve in time as a consequence of a multi-dimensional belief analysis, and we 
use the framework of conceivable situations in order to model this evolution.  </abstract>

It relieves the programmer from the task to provide a consistent treatment for every single

smaller and more robust than those that do not use it. We believe that this technique will

<abstract> Abstract. The simple Bayesian classifier is known to be optimal when attributes are independent 
given the class, but the question of whether other sufficient conditions for its optimality exist has 
so far not been explored. Empirical results showing that it performs surprisingly well in many 
domains containing clear attribute dependences suggest that the answer to this question may be 
positive. This article shows that, although the Bayesian classifier's probability estimates are only 
optimal under quadratic loss if the independence assumption holds, the classifier itself can be 
optimal under zero-one loss (misclassification rate) even when this assumption is violated by a 
wide margin. The region of quadratic-loss optimality of the Bayesian classifier is in fact a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the region of zero-one optimality. This implies that the Bayesian 
classifier has a much greater range of applicability than previously thought. For example, in this 
article it is shown to be optimal for learning conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they 
violate the independence assumption. Further, studies in artificial domains show that it will often 
outperform more powerful classifiers for common training set sizes and numbers of attributes, even 
if its bias is a priori much less appropriate to the domain. This article's results also imply that 
detecting attribute dependence is not necessarily the best way to extend the Bayesian classifier, 
and this is also verified empirically.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Speech disfluencies (such as filled pauses, repetitions, restarts) are 
among the characteristics distinguishing spontaneous speech from 
planned or read speech. We introduce a language model that predicts disfluencies probabilistically and uses an edited, fluent context 
to predict following words. The model is based on a generalization 
of the standard N-gram language model. It uses dynamic programming to compute the probability of a word sequence, taking into 
account possible hidden disfluency events. We analyze the model's performance for various disfluency types on the Switchboard 
corpus. We find that the model reduces word perplexity in the 
neighborhood of disfluency events; however, overall differences 
are small and have no significant impact on recognition accuracy. 
We also note that for modeling of the most frequent type of dis-fluency, filled pauses, a segmentation of utterances into linguistic 
(rather than acoustic) units is required. Our analysis illustrates a 
generally useful technique for language model evaluation based on 
local perplexity comparisons.  </abstract>

build a system with strong enough biases that it can learn from a reasonably 
small number of examples, while still having adequate flexibility to learn the 
hand-action verbs of any language. The completed system should demonstrate its knowledge both by labelling its own behavior and by carrying out

<abstract> Abstract 
We are analyzing storage structures for two and three dimensional raster type data which are used 
for feature retrieval. The features are one, two or three dimensional objects with regular outlines 
like a rectangle or a prism. The features could be parts of a map or image, an area of special 
interest for searching after oil, a sequence of ultra sound images, and so on. The storage medium 
is magnetic disk. The data are stored in chunks or blocks representing a regular part of the source 
object. We analyze the shape and the size to minimize the cost of retrieval. The optimization is 
based on minimum time to do retrieval. We have five combinations: Lines and areas from areas and 
volumes, and volumes from volumes. The optimal block sizes for random retrieval varies, with case, 
feature size and disk characteristics. One general observation is that longer disk tracks gives larger 
blocks. For line retrieval the optimal block size is only depending on disk track length. For other 
cases it is also depending on the feature size. For partly sequential retrieval the block size is not the 
actual block size used during retrieval, but the smallest addressing unit, and the optimal addressing 
unit could be rather small. 
The analysis reveals that using too small blocks could be very costly. The time could easily 
double or triple if small blocks are used. In many cases the optimal block size is several tracks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Video servers are important for applications which make 
use of digital video. The video servers should provide better 
functionality than most of today's video servers offer, - e.g., 
support of flexible and instant user interactions, delivery of 
multiple video formats and support of virtual video documents. In this paper we discuss the requirements that video 
servers should fulfill and we describe the design and implementation of the Elvira video server. The Elvira video server 
is built on a cluster of standard UNIX workstations interconnected by an ATM switch. The capacity of the Elvira server 
is evaluated and we show the effects of different strategies 
for allocation of video data across nodes and disks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In a database system, read operations are much more 
common than write operations, and consequently, database 
systems have been read optimized. As the size of main memory increases, more of the database read requests will be satisfied from the buffer system, and the amount of disk write 
operations relative to disk read operations will increase. 
This calls for a focus on write optimized database systems. 
In this paper, we present solutions to this problem. We describe in detail the data structures and algorithms needed 
to realize a write optimized object-oriented database system 
in the context of Vagabond, an OODB currently being implemented at our department. In Vagabond, focus has been 
to provide support for applications which have earlier used 
file systems because of the limited data bandwidth in current 
database systems, typical examples are super computing applications and geographical information systems  </abstract>

<title> On the Computational Requirements of 
Virtual Reality Systems 1  </title>
<author> Frank Devai  </author>
<affiliation> School of Computing & Mathematics, University of Ulster  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
The computational requirements of high-quality, real-time rendering exceeds the limits of 
generally available computing power. However illumination effects, except shadows, are 
less noticeable on moving pictures. Shadows can be produced with the same techniques 
used for visibility computations, therefore the basic requirements of real-time rendering 
are transformations, pre-selection of the part of the scene to be displayed and visibility 
computations. Transformations scale well, ie, their time requirement grows linearly with 
the input size. Pre-selection, if implemented by the traditional way of polygon clipping, 
has a growing rate of N log N in the worst case, where N is the total number of edges in 
the scene. Visibility computations, exhibiting a quadratic growing rate, are the bottleneck 
from a theoretical point of view. Three approaches are discussed to speed up visibility 
computations: (i) reducing the expected running time to O(N log N ) (ii) using approximation algorithms with O(N K) worst-case time, where K is the linear resolution of the 
image, and (iii) applying parallel techniques leading to logarithmic time in the worst-case. 
Though the growing rate of the time requirement of pre-selection is significantly slower 
than that of visibility, it is demonstrated that pre-selection has to deal with a significantly 
higher amount of data than visibility computations, as the average clipping volume is 1/27 
of the volume of the model.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe the implementation of a multi-purpose data analysis laboratory, DataLab-J, in 
the programming language Java. We briefly trace the stages of the evolution of DataLab from a 
FORTRAN-IV system in 1973 to the current Java development. Description of this evolution allows 
us to discuss some key design and functionality decisions and issues that arose throughout the years; 
many of these issues remain topical, so, in addition to an evaluation of Java, we identify and discuss 
what are for us the major issues in the design of such software. Moreover, we address questions 
raised by the need to convert legacy systems, e.g. those programmed in C and various versions of 
FORTRAN. The experience of redesign and implementation in Java is described, together with a 
brief evaluation of the suitability of Java for 'number-crunching'. Overall conclusions are drawn, 
regarding design of such software, lessons learned, traps to avoid, and on Java itself.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
We present recent work on integration of visual information (automatic lip-reading) with acoustic speech for better overall speech recognition. A Multi-State Time Delay 
Neural Network performs the recognition of spelled letter 
sequences taking advantage of lip images from a standard 
camera. The problems addressed include efficient but effective representation of the visual information and optimum 
manner of combining the two modalities when rendering a 
decision. We show results for several alternatives to direct 
gray level image as the visual evidence. These are: Principal 
Components, Linear Discriminants, and DFT coefficients. 
Dimensionality of the input is decreased by a factor of 12 
while maintaining recognition rates. Combination of the 
visual and acoustic information is performed at three different levels of abstraction. Results suggest that integration 
of higher order input features works best. On a continuous 
spelling task, visual-alone recognition of 45-55%, when combined with acoustic data, lowers audio-alone error rates by 
30-40%.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
A stochastically based approach for the semantic analysis component of a natural spoken language system for the ATIS task has been 
developed. The semantic analyzer of the spoken language system 
already in use at LIMSI makes use of a rule-based case grammar. In 
this work, the system of rules for the semantic analysis is replaced 
with a relatively simple, first order Hidden Markov Model. The 
performance of the two approaches can be compared because they 
use identical semantic representations despite their rather different 
methods for meaning extraction. We use an evaluation methodology 
that assesses performance at different semantic levels, including the 
database response comparison used in the ARPA ATIS paradigm.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this paper we consider the problem of tracking a subset of a domain (called the target) which 
changes gradually over time. A single (unknown) probability distribution over the domain is used 
to generate random examples for the learning algorithm and measure the speed at which the target 
changes. 
Clearly, the more rapidly the target moves, the harder it is for the algorithm to maintain a good 
approximation of the target. Therefore we evaluate algorithms based on how much movement of 
the target can be tolerated between examples while predicting with accuracy *. Furthermore, the 
complexity of the class H of possible targets, as measured by d, its VC-dimension, also effects the 
difficulty of tracking the target concept. 
We show that if the problem of minimizing the number of disagreements with a sample from 
among concepts in a class H can be approximated to within a factor k, then there is a simple tracking 
algorithm for H which can achieve a probability * of making a mistake if the target movement rate 
is at most a constant times * 2 =(k(d + k) ln 1 
* ), where d is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of 
H. Also, we show that if H is properly PAC-learnable, then there is an efficient (randomized) 
algorithm that with high probability approximately minimizes disagreements to within a factor of 
7d + 1, yielding an efficient tracking algorithm for H which tolerates drift rates up to a constant 
times * 2 =(d 2 ln 1 
In addition, we prove complementary results for the classes of halfspaces and axis-aligned hy 
perrectangles showing that the maximum rate of drift that any algorithm (even with unlimited 
computational power) can tolerate is a constant times * 2 =d.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Feature selection is a problem of choosing a subset of relevant 
features. In general, only exhaustive search can bring about the optimal 
subset. With a monotonic measure, exhaustive search can be avoided 
without sacrificing optimality. Unfortunately, most error- or distance-based measures are not monotonic. A new measure is employed in this 
work that is monotonic and fast to compute. The search for relevant 
features according to this measure is guaranteed to be complete but not 
exhaustive. Experiments are conducted for verification.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Although backpropagation neural networks 
generally predict better than decision trees do 
for pattern classification problems, they are often regarded as black boxes, i.e., their predictions are not as interpretable as those of decision trees. This paper argues that this is because there has been no proper technique that 
enables us to do so. With an algorithm that 
can extract rules 1 , by drawing parallels with 
those of decision trees, we show that the predictions of a network can be explained via rules extracted from it, thereby, the network can be understood. Experiments demonstrate that rules 
extracted from neural networks are comparable with those of decision trees in terms of predictive accuracy, number of rules and average 
number of conditions for a rule; they preserve 
high predictive accuracy of original networks.  </abstract>

<title> Integrating Pedagogical Agents into Virtual Environments  </title>

Allen Munro 1  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
In order for a virtual environment to be effective as a training tool, it is not enough to 
concentrate on the fidelity of the renderings and the accuracy of the simulated behaviors. 
The environment should help trainees develop an understanding of the task being trained, 
and should provide guidance and assistance as needed. This paper describes a system for 
developing virtual environments in which pedagogical capabilities are incorporated into 
autonomous agents that interact with trainees. These pedagogical agents can monitor 
trainees progress and provide guidance and assistance. The agents interact with 
simulations of objects in the environment, and with trainees. The paper describes the 
architectural features of the environment and of the agents that permit the agents to meet 
instructional objectives within the virtual environment. It also discusses how agent-based 
instruction is combined with other methods of delivering instruction.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Large-scale generation of natural language requires an 
abstract meaning representation and a mechanism for 
integrating immense amounts of lexical, morphological, grammatical, and conceptual knowledge. The 
availability of corpus-based statistical knowledge motivates the invention of a new style of generation in 
which word lattices compactly encode many possible 
sentence renderings and a statistical extractor chooses 
the best ones. The focus of generation thus shifts 
to how word lattices can be generated from abstract 
meaning representation. This paper presents a flexible 
meaning representation scheme and generation mechanism. It includes an efficient generation algorithm and 
grammar formalism that maps from a meaning representation to a lattice. This mapping is flexible enough 
to allow meaning representation along a continuum of 
semantic depth.  </abstract>

In this paper, we propose a congestion control

to provide timely and accurate feedback on behalf of 
congested subtrees of a multicast distribution tree. 
Our algorithm does not need to compute round-trip 
time (RTT) from all receivers to the source, nor does 
it require knowledge of group membership or network 
topology. Through simulations, we evaluate our algorithm with and without TCP cross traffic. This initial evaluation study shows that our algorithm takes 
advantage of network bandwidth when available, yet 
does not starve competing flows.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Information gathering agents can automate the task of retrieving and integrating data 
from a large number of diverse information sources. The key issue in their performance is 
efficient query planning that minimizes the number of information sources used to answer 
a query. Previous work on query planning has considered generating information gathering 
plans solely based on compile-time analysis of the query and the models of the information 
sources. We argue that at compile-time it may not be possible to generate an efficient 
plan for retrieving the requested information because of the large number of possibly 
relevant sources. We describe an approach that naturally extends query planning to use 
run-time information to optimize queries that involve many sources. First, we describe an 
algorithm for generating a discrimination matrix, which is a data structure that identifies 
the information that can be sensed at run-time to optimize a query plan. Next, we describe 
how the discrimination matrix is used to decide which of the possible run-time sensing 
actions to perform. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach yields significant savings 
(over 90% for some queries) in a real-world task.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Semantic query optimization can dramatically speed up database query answering by 
knowledge intensive reformulation. But the 
problem of how to learn required semantic 
rules has not previously been solved. This 
paper describes an approach using an inductive learning algorithm to solve the problem. In our approach, learning is triggered 
by user queries and then the system induces semantic rules from the information in 
databases. The inductive learning algorithm 
used in this approach can select an appropriate set of relevant attributes from a potentially huge number of attributes in real-world 
databases. Experimental results demonstrate 
that this approach can learn sufficient background knowledge to reformulate queries and 
provide a 57 percent average performance improvement.  </abstract>

One of the open problems listed in [ Rivest and

does that combination. The idea is to represent 
the states of the learned model using observable 
symbols as well as hidden symbols that are constructed during learning. These hidden symbols are created to reflect the distinct behaviors 
of the model states. The distinct behaviors are 
represented as local distinguishing experiments 
(LDEs) (not to be confused with global distinguishing sequences), and these LDEs are created when the learner's prediction mismatches 
the actual observation from the unknown machine. To synchronize the model with the environment, these LDEs can also be concatenated to form a homing sequence. It can 
be shown that D can learn, with probability 
1 ~, a model that is an *-approximation of 
the unknown machine, in a number of actions 
polynomial in the size of the environment and  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Intelligent interaction in multi-agent domains frequently requires an agent to track other 
agents' mental states: their current goals, beliefs, and intentions. Accuracy in this agent 
tracking task is critically dependent on the accuracy of the tracker's (tracking agent's) model 
of the trackee (tracked agent). Unfortunately, in real-world situations, model imperfections 
arise due to the tracker's resource and information constraints, as well as due to trackees' 
dynamic behavior modification. While such model imperfections are unavoidable, a tracker 
must nonetheless attempt to be adaptive in its agent tracking. This article identifies key issues 
in adaptive agent tracking and presents an approach called DEFT. At its core, DEFT is based 
on discrimination-based learning. The main idea is to identify the deficiency of a model based 
on tracking failures, and revise the model by using features that are critical in discriminating 
successful and failed tracking episodes. Because in real-world situations the set of candidate 
discriminating features is very large, DEFT relies on knowledge-based focusing to limit the 
discrimination to those features that it determines were relevant in successful tracking episodes 
with an autonomous explanation capability as a major source of this knowledge. This article 
reports on experiments with an implementation of key aspects of DEFT in a complex synthetic 
air-to-air combat domain.  </abstract>

Mixed-initiative systems present the challenge of finding an effective level of interaction between humans 
and computers. Machine learning presents a promising approach to this problem in the form of systems 
that automatically adapt their behavior to accommodate different users. In this paper, we present an empirical study of learning user models in an adaptive 
assistant for crisis scheduling. We describe the problem domain and the scheduling assistant, then present 
an initial formulation of the adaptive assistant's learning task and the results of a baseline study. After this, 
we report the results of three subsequent experiments 
that investigate the effects of problem reformulation 
and representation augmentation. The results suggest 
that problem reformulation leads to significantly better accuracy without sacrificing the usefulness of the 
learned behavior. The studies also raise several interesting issues in adaptive assistance for scheduling.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Much of the work on execution assumes that the agent 
constantly senses the environment, which lets it respond 
immediately to errors or unexpected events. In this paper, we argue that this purely reactive strategy is only 
optimal if sensing is inexpensive, and we formulate a simple model of execution that incorporates the cost of sensing. We present an average-case analysis of this model, 
which shows that in domains with high sensing cost or 
low probability of error, a more `automatic' strategy - 
one with long intervals between sensing can lead to 
less expensive execution. The analysis also shows that 
the distance to the goal has no effect on the optimal sensing interval. These results run counter to the prevailing 
wisdom in the planning community, but they promise a 
more balanced approach to the interleaving of execution 
and sensing.  </abstract>

<author> Elisa Bertino Sushil Jajodia Luigi Mancini Indrajit Ray x  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
The concurrency control requirements for transaction processing in a multilevel secure file system are different from those in conventional transaction processing systems. 
In particular, there is the need to coordinate transactions at different security levels 
avoiding both potential timing covert channels and the starvation of transactions at 
higher security levels. Suppose a transaction at a lower security level attempts to write 
a data item that is being read by a transaction at a higher security level. On the one 
hand, a timing covert channel arises if the transaction at the lower security level is either 
delayed or aborted by the scheduler. On the other hand, the transaction at the high 
security level may be subjected to an indefinite delay if it is forced to abort repeatedly. 
This paper extends the classical two-phase locking mechanism to multilevel secure 
file systems. The scheme presented here prevents potential timing covert channels and 
avoids the abort of higher level transactions nonetheless guaranteeing serializability. 
The programmer is provided with a powerful set of linguistic constructs that supports 
exception handling, partial rollback and forward recovery. The proper use of these 
constructs can prevent the indefinite delay in completion of a higher level transaction, 
and allows the programmer to trade off starvation with transaction isolation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We propose a new image retrieval method based 
on human perceptual clustering of color images. This 
color clustering produces for each image a small set of 
representative colors which captures the color properties of the image, and a small set of sizable contiguous 
regions which captures the spatial/geometrical properties of the image. The proposed method outperforms 
the traditional histogram and its improved methods not 
only with its richer image retrieval capabilities which 
cover a wider spectrum of user requirements, but also 
with its powerful indexing scheme which is essential to 
cater for large scale image databases.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Introspective reasoning about a system's own 
reasoning processes can form the basis for 
learning to refine those reasoning processes. 
The ROBBIE 1 system uses introspective reasoning to monitor the retrieval process of a 
case-based planner to detect retrieval of inappropriate cases. When retrieval problems 
are detected, the source of the problems is explained and the explanations are used to determine new indices to use during future case 
retrieval. The goal of ROBBIE's learning is to 
increase its ability to focus retrieval on relevant 
cases, with the aim of simultaneously decreasing the number of candidates to consider and 
increasing the likelihood that the system will be 
able to successfully adapt the retrieved cases to 
fit the current situation. We evaluate the benefits of the approach in light of empirical results 
examining the effects of index learning in the 
ROBBIE system.  </abstract>

This paper deals with the problem of global stabilization of linear discrete time systems by means of 
bounded feedback laws. The main result proved is an analog of one proved for the continuous time case 
by the authors, and shows that such stabilization is possible if and only if the system is stabilizable 
with arbitrary controls and the transition matrix has spectral radius less or equal to one. The proof 
provides in principle an algorithm for the construction of such feedback laws, which can be implemented 
either as cascades or as parallel connections ("single hidden layer neural networks") of simple saturation 
functions.  </abstract>

<title> A Construction of a Cipher 
From a Single Pseudorandom Permutation  </title>
<author> Shimon Even 1 and Yishay Mansour 2  </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
We suggest a scheme for a block cipher which uses only one randomly chosen permutation, F . The key, consisting of two blocks, K 1 
and K 2 is used in the following way: The message block is XORed 
with K 1 before applying F , and the outcome is XORed with K 2 , to 
produce the cryptogram block. We show that the resulting cipher 
is secure (when the permutation is random or pseudorandom). This 
removes the need to store, or generate a multitude of permutations.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. Traditional decision theory has assumed that agents have complete, consistent and readily available beliefs and preferences. Obviously, even if 
an expert system has complete and consistent beliefs, it cannot have them readily 
available. Moreover, some beliefs about beliefs are not even approximately computable. It is shown that if all players have complete and consistent beliefs, they 
can compute approximate beliefs about beliefs of any order by considering events 
arbitrarily close in some well-defined sense to the ones in question.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Abstract. The subject of this paper is finding small sample spaces for joint distributions of 
n discrete random variables. Such distributions 
are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form P r(E) = . 
We show that the problem of deciding whether 
there exists any distribution satisfying a given 
set of constraints is NP-hard. However, if the 
constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them which is supported by 
a "small" sample space (one whose cardinality is 
equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where 
the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of n independent 
random variables, a small sample space can be 
constructed in polynomial time. This last result 
is also useful for de-randomizing algorithms. We 
demonstrate this technique by an application to 
the problem of finding large independent sets in 
sparse hypergraphs.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Several methods of increasing the speed and simplicity of the computation of off-axis transmission holograms are 
presented, with applications to the real-time display of holographic images. A bipolar intensity approach enables a 
linear summation of interference fringes, a factor of two speed increase, and the elimination of image noise caused by 
object self-interference. An order of magnitude speed increase is obtained through the use of precomputed look-up 
tables containing a large array of elemental interference patterns corresponding to point source contributions from 
each of the possible locations in image space. Results achieved using a data-parallel supercomputer to compute 
horizontal-parallax-only holographic patterns containing 6 megasamples indicate that an image comprised of 10,000 
points with arbitrary brightness (grayscale) can be computed in under one second.  </abstract>

Authoring is usually one of the most difficult parts in the design and implementation of hypertext and 
hypermedia systems. This problem is exacerbated if the data to be presented by the system is speech, 
rather than text or graphics, because of the slow and serial nature of speech. This paper provides an 
overview of speech-only hypermedia, discusses the difficulties associated with authoring databases for 
such a system, and explores a variety of techniques to assist in the authoring process.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
This paper applies genetic programming 
to the evolution of intelligent agents that 
gradually build internal representations of 
their surroundings for later use in 
planning. The method used allows for the 
creation of dynamically determined 
representations that are not pre-designed 
by the human creator of the system. In an 
illustrative path-planning problem, evolved 
programs learn a model of their world and 
use this internal representation to plan 
their successive actions. The results show 
that the proposed method is successful in 
evolving programs that solve the planning 
problem and is thus a worthy basis for 
further investigation.  </abstract>

The information that a pattern of firing in the output layer of a feedforward 
network of threshold-linear neurons conveys about the network's inputs is 
considered. A replica-symmetric solution is found to be stable for all but 
small amounts of noise. The region of instability depends on the contribution 
of the threshold and the sparseness: for distributed pattern distributions, 
the unstable region extends to higher noise variances than for very sparse 
distributions, for which it is almost nonexistant.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Indexing of cases is an important topic for Memory-Based Reasoning(MBR). One key problem is how to 
assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several 
weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so it 
is necessary to discretize numeric values by classification. Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality. 
We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can 
handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the 
same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal in the sense that they maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many 
cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some 
other weighting methods. The results also indicate 
that it can distinguish relevant attributes from irrelevant ones, and can tolerate noisy data.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. This paper presents a comparative study of several methods for estimating 
the true error of treestructured regression models. We evaluate these methods in the 
context of regression tree pruning. Pruning is considered a key issue for obtaining 
reliable treestructured models in a real world scenario. The major step of a pruning 
process consists of obtaining accurate estimates of the error of alternative tree 
models. We evaluate experimentally four methods for obtaining these estimates in 
twelve domains. The goal of this evaluation was to characterise the performance of 
the methods in the task of selecting the best possible tree among the set of trees 
considered during pruning. The results of the comparison show that certain 
estimators lead to poor decisions in some domains. The Cross Validation variant that 
we have proposed achieved the best results on the setups we have considered.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Recurrent neural networks readily process, recognize and generate temporal sequences. By encoding 
grammatical strings as temporal sequences, recurrent neural networks can be trained to behave like deterministic sequential finite-state automata. Algorithms have been developed for extracting grammatical 
rules from trained networks. Using a simple method for inserting prior knowledge (or rules) into recurrent 
neural networks, we show that recurrent neural networks are able to perform rule revision. Rule revision 
is performed by comparing the inserted rules with the rules in the finite-state automata extracted from 
trained networks. The results from training a recurrent neural network to recognize a known non-trivial, 
randomly generated regular grammar show that not only do the networks preserve correct rules but that 
they are able to correct through training inserted rules which were initially incorrect. (By incorrect, we 
mean that the rules were not the ones in the randomly generated grammar.)  </abstract>

particularly prominent in NARX models. 
We show that using intelligent memory order selection through pruning and good initial

systems on problems as diverse as grammatical inference and time series prediction.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
One of the most important aspects of any machine learning paradigm is how it scales according 
to problem size and complexity. Using a task with known optimal training error, and a pre-specified 
maximum number of training updates, we investigate the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm 
with respect to a) the complexity of the required function approximation, b) the size of the network in 
relation to the size required for an optimal solution, and c) the degree of noise in the training data. In 
general, for a) the solution found is worse when the function to be approximated is more complex, for 
b) oversized networks can result in lower training and generalization error in certain cases, and for c) 
the use of committee or ensemble techniques can be more beneficial as the level of noise in the training 
data is increased. For the experiments we performed, we do not obtain the optimal solution in any case. 
We further support the observation that larger networks can produce better training and generalization 
error using a face recognition example where a network with many more parameters than training points 
generalizes better than smaller networks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract  
World Wide Web (WWW) search engines (e.g. AltaVista, Infoseek, HotBot, etc.) have a number of 
deficiencies including: periods of downtime, low coverage of the WWW, inconsistent and inefficient user 
interfaces, out of date databases, poor relevancy ranking and precision, and difficulties with spamming 
techniques. Meta search engines have been introduced which address some of these and other difficulties in 
searching the WWW. However, current meta search engines retain some of these difficulties and may also 
introduce their own problems (e.g. reduced relevance because one or more of the search engines returns results 
with poor relevance). We present Inquirus, the NECI meta search engine, which addresses many of the 
deficiencies in current techniques. Rather than working with the list of documents and summaries returned by 
search engines, as current meta search engines typically do, the Inquirus meta search engine works by 
downloading and analyzing the individual documents. The Inquirus meta search engine makes improvements 
over existing search engines in a number of areas, e.g.: more useful document summaries incorporating query 
term context, identification of both pages which no longer exist and pages which no longer contain the query 
terms, advanced detection of duplicate pages, improved document ranking using proximity information, 
dramatically improved precision for certain queries by using specific expressive forms, and quick jump links 
and highlighting when viewing the full documents.   </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper shows that members of the fourier transform family are the only linear 
transforms that have a convolution theorem, that is, that can replace O(N 2 ) operations 
of a convolution in a time domain by O(N) operations in a transform domain. Generally, 
there is an additional cost to compute the transform itself. Our observation is motivated by 
recent activity in wavelet and subband decompositions and related spectral analyses, which 
are attractive alternatives for signal compression applications. A natural question when 
using such techniques is to determine if convolutions of N -point signals can be calculated 
with fewer operations in a compressed transform domain than in an uncompressed time 
domain. The answer is negative for a broad set of assumptions. This paper indicates what 
assumptions must be relaxed in seeking a linear transform that has a convolution theorem 
comparable to the convolution theorem for fourier transforms.  </abstract>

<title> Scheduling To Minimize Average Completion Time: 
Off-line and On-line Algorithms  </title>
<author> Leslie A. Hall David B. Shmoys Joel Wein   </author>
<abstract> Abstract 
Time-indexed linear programming formulations have recently received a great deal of attention for their practical 
effectiveness in solving a number of single-machine scheduling problems. We show that these formulations are also an 
important tool in the design of approximation algorithms 
with good worst-case performance guarantees. We give simple new rounding techniques to convert an optimal fractional 
solution into a feasible schedule for which we can prove a 
constant-factor performance guarantee, thereby giving the 
first theoretical evidence of the strength of these relaxations. 
Specifically, we consider the problem of minimizing the 
total weighted job completion time on a single machine 
subject to precedence constraints, and give a polynomial-time (4 + *)-approximation algorithm, for any * &gt; 0; 
the best previously known guarantee for this problem was 
superlogarithmic. With somewhat larger constants, we also 
show how to extend this result to the case with release date 
constraints, and still more generally, to the case with m 
identical parallel machines. We give two other techniques for 
problems in which there are release dates, but no precedence 
constraints: the first is based on other new LP rounding 
algorithms, whereas the second is a general framework for 
designing on-line algorithms to minimize the total weighted 
completion time.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric massive thin shells 
in the general relativity is considered. Two different constraint dynamical 
systems representing this dynamics have been described recently; the relation 
of these two systems is investigated. The symmetry groups of both systems 
are found. The systems are reduced to the presymplectic manifolds 1 and 2 , 
lest non-physical aspects like gauge fixings or embeddings in extended phase 
spaces hinder the argument. The following facts are shown. 1 is three- and 2 
is five-dimensional; the description of the shell dynamics by 1 is incomplete 
so that some measurable properties of the shell cannot be predicted. 1 is 
locally equivalent to a subsystem of 2 and the corresponding local morphisms 
are not unique, due to the large symmetry group of 2 . The local equivalence 
explains why the same radial equation results from both systems; what is, 
however, the physical importance of just local, but not global equivalence of 
constraint dynamical systems remains unclear.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In this brief contribution we present the three principal laser remote 
sensing ( lidar) techniques developed to retrieve the vertical profiling of 
clouds and of the suspended aerosols (extinction and backscatter) in the 
lower atmosphere, namely in the 0-7 km altitude region. The three lidar 
techniques include the elastic ( Klett inversion, Doppler broadening) and 
the nonelastic backscattering techniques ( Raman scattering). We report 
on the potential of these techniques, as well as on the typical accuracies 
of these techniques in the retrieval of the cloud and aerosol extinction 
and backscatter vertical profiles in the troposphere (0-7 km ASL).  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT 
Large scale distributed systems are becoming of 
paramount importance, due to the evolution of technology and to the interest of market. Their development, 
however, is not yet supported by a sound technological and methodological background, as the results developed for small size distributed systems often do not 
scale up. Recently, mobile code languages (MCLs) have 
been proposed as a technological answer to the problem. 
In this work, we abstract away from the details of these 
languages by deriving design paradigms exploiting code 
mobility that are independent of any particular technology. We present such design paradigms, together 
with a discussion of their features, their application domain, and some hints about the selection of the correct 
paradigm for a given distributed application.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present computer simulations of a model of the brain 
mechanisms operating in short-term memory tasks that are 
consistent with the anatomy and physiology of prefrontal 
cortex and associated subcortical structures. These 
simulations include dynamical processes in thalamo-cortical loops which are used to generate short-term 
persistent responses in prefrontal cortex. We discuss this 
model in terms of the representation of input stimuli in 
cortical association areas and prefrontal short-term 
memory areas. We report on interference phenomena that 
result from the interaction of these dynamical processes 
and lateral projections within cortical columns. These 
interference phenomena can be used to elucidate the 
representational organization of short-term memory.  </abstract>

<pubnum> TR 94-1447  </pubnum>
<affiliation> Department of Computer Science, Cornell University  </affiliation>
<abstract> Abstract 
We develop necessary conditions for the development of asynchronous distributed 
software that will perform uniform actions (events that if performed by any process, 
must be performed at all processes). The paper focuses on dynamic uniformity, which 
differs from the classical problems in that processes continually leave and join the 
ongoing computation. Here, we first treat a static version of the problem (lacking joins), 
and then extend the results so obtained to also include joins. Our results demonstrate 
that in contrast to Consensus, which cannot be solved in asynchronous systems with 
even a single faulty process, dynamic uniformity can be solved using a failure detection 
mechanism that makes bounded numbers of mistakes. Because dynamic uniformity 
arises in systems that maintain safety within a "primary partition" of a network, our 
paper provides a rigorous characterization of the framework upon which several existing 
distributed programming environments are based.  </abstract>

<title> On the Boosting Ability of Top-Down 
Decision Tree Learning Algorithms   </title>

<abstract> Abstract 
We analyze the performance of top-down algorithms for decision tree learning, such as those employed 
by the widely used C4.5 and CART software packages. Our main result is a proof that such algorithms 
are boosting algorithms. By this we mean that if the functions that label the internal nodes of the 
decision tree can weakly approximate the unknown target function, then the top-down algorithms we 
study will amplify this weak advantage to build a tree achieving any desired level of accuracy. The bounds 
we obtain for this amplification show an interesting dependence on the splitting criterion used by the 
top-down algorithm. More precisely, if the functions used to label the internal nodes have error 1=2  
as approximations to the target function, then for the splitting criteria used by CART and C4.5, trees 
of size (1=*) O(1= 2 * 2 ) and (1=*) O(log(1=*)= 2 ) (respectively) suffice to drive the error below *. Thus (for 
example), a small constant advantage over random guessing is amplified to any larger constant advantage 
with trees of constant size. For a new splitting criterion suggested by our analysis, the much stronger 
bound of (1=*) O(1= 2 ) (which is polynomial in 1=*) is obtained, which is provably optimal for decision 
tree algorithms. The differing bounds have a natural explanation in terms of concavity properties of the 
splitting criterion. 
The primary contribution of this work is in proving that some popular and empirically successful 
heuristics that are based on first principles meet the criteria of an independently motivated theoretical 
model.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper re-examines the problem of parameter estimation in Bayesian networks with missing values and 
hidden variables from the perspective of recent work in 
on-line learning [12]. We provide a unified framework 
for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line 
learning, where the model is continuously adapted to new 
data cases as they arrive, and the more traditional batch 
learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used 
in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case, 
our framework encompasses both the gradient projection 
algorithm [2, 3] and the EM algorithm [14] for Bayesian 
networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and 
batch parameter update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows 
faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parame 
ters than does standard EM.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In recent years, networks with media rates of 100 Mbit/second or more have become widely available (FDDI, ATM, 
HIPPI, ..). However, many computer systems cannot make use of the available bandwidth because of the high 
overhead associated with network communication. In this paper we review the operations involved in communication over high-speed networks, and we describe optimizations of the network interface that improve network 
throughput. We also discuss how the payoff of the optimizations is influenced by features of the host software and 
architecture. This paper is based on our experience with the interfaces for the Nectar and Gigabit Nectar networks.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The use of primary effects of operators is an effective approach to improving the 
efficiency of planning. The characterization of "good" primary effects, however, has 
remained at an informal level and there have been no algorithms for selecting primary 
effects of operators. 
We formalize the use of primary effects in planning and present a criterion for 
selecting useful primary effects, which guarantees efficiency and completeness. We 
analyze the efficiency of planning with primary effects and the quality of the resulting 
plans. 
We then describe a learning algorithm that automatically selects primary effects 
and demonstrate, both analytically and empirically, that the use of this algorithm 
significantly reduces planning time and does not compromise completeness.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
In recent years, researchers have been dedicated to the 
study of underactuated manipulators which have more 
joints than control actuators. In previous works, 
assumptions were made as to the existence of enough 
dynamic coupling between the active and the passive 
joints of the manipulator for it to be possible to control 
the position of the passive joints via the dynamic 
coupling. In this work, the authors aim to develop an 
index to measure the dynamic coupling, so as to address 
when control of the underactuated system is possible, 
and how the motion and robot configuration can be 
designed. We discuss extensively the nature of the 
dynamic coupling and of the proposed coupling index, 
and their applications in the analysis and design of 
underactuated systems, and in control and planning of 
robot motion configuration.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We present the spine calculus S !ffi&&gt; as an efficient representation for the linear -calculus !ffi&&gt; 
which includes intuitionistic functions (!), linear functions (ffi), additive pairing (&), and additive unit 
(&gt;). S !ffi&&gt; enhances the representation of Church's simply typed -calculus as abstract Bohm trees 
by enforcing extensionality and by incorporating linear constructs. This approach permits procedures 
such as unification to retain the efficient head access that characterizes first-order term languages without 
the overhead of performing -conversions at run time. Potential applications lie in proof search, logic 
programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. We define the spine calculus, give 
translations of !ffi&&gt; into S !ffi&&gt; and vice-versa, prove their soundness and completeness with respect 
to typing and reductions, and show that the spine calculus is strongly normalizing and admits unique 
canonical forms.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Substrates for most of today's electronic products contain many wiring layers 
which are individually fabricated, mechanically registered with one another, 
and laminated together. Alignment tolerances of 0.05 mm to 0.1 mm are 
sufficient to register the vertical connection pads or vias on each layer. More 
aggressive designs of the future will, however, require manufacturing accuracies of at least an order of magnitude better to accommodate much finer 
wire widths and pin spacings. Conventional equipment relying on mechanical 
"pin-in-slot" methods will likely be inadequate, and a new approach will be 
needed. 
We describe here a sensor-based approach for registration and stacking 
of electronic substrate sublaminates that replaces pin-in-slot methods, yet 
does not require accurate automation equipment. A pilot work cell for this 
approach is presented, which has an IBM 7576 coarse-positioning robot, a 
specially-developed fine-positioning robot, optical sensors, and several routine 
low accuracy fixtures. A novel robot bracing method was used to minimize 
environmental vibration during sublaminate stacking. 
Pairs of test sublaminates, each containing an identical pattern of 100 
m holes, were aligned, stacked and bonded. The accuracy of registration  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Gesture-Based Programming is a new paradigm to ease 
the burden of programming robots. By tapping in to the 
users wealth of experience with contact transitions, 
compliance, uncertainty and operations sequencing, we 
hope to provide a more intuitive programming environment 
for complex, real-world tasks based on the expressiveness 
of non-verbal communication. A requirement for this to be 
accomplished is the ability to interpret gestures to infer the 
intentions behind them. As a first step toward this goal, this 
paper presents an application of distributed perception for 
inferring a users intentions by observing tactile gestures. 
These gestures consist of sparse, inexact, physical 
nudges applied to the robots end effector for the 
purpose of modifying its trajectory in free space. A set of 
independent agents - each with its own local, fuzzified, 
heuristic model of a particular trajectory parameter - 
observes data from a wrist force/torque sensor to evaluate 
the gestures. The agents then independently determine the 
confidence of their respective findings and distributed 
arbitration resolves the interpretation through voting.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We describe the design and implementation of a compiler that automatically translates ordinary 
programs written in a subset of ML into code that generates native code at run time. Run-time 
code generation can make use of values and invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time, 
yielding code that is superior to statically optimal code. But the cost of optimizing and generating 
code at run time can be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce 
the cost of run-time code generation by an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code 
quality. Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an average cost of six cycles per 
instruction generated at run time.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. The interface specification of a procedure describes the procedure's 
behavior using pre- and postconditions. These pre- and postconditions are written using various functions. If some of these functions are partial, or underspec-ified, then the procedure specification may not be well-defined. 
We show how to write pre- and postcondition specifications that avoid such 
problems, by having the precondition "protect" the postcondition from the effects 
of partiality and underspecification. We formalize the notion of protection from 
partiality in the context of specification languages like VDM-SL and COLD-K. 
We also formalize the notion of protection from underspecification for the Larch 
family of specification languages, and for Larch show how one can prove that a 
procedure specification is protected from the effects of underspecification.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract: 
Software architects use a number of commonly-recognized styles 
to guide their design of system structures. Each of these is appropriate for 
some classes of problems, but none is suitable for all problems. How, then, 
does a software designer choose an architecture suitable for the problem at 
hand? Two kinds of information are required: (1)  
careful discrimination 
among 
the candidate architectures and (2)  
design guidance 
on how to make 
appropriate choices. Here we support  
careful discrimination 
with a 
preliminary classification of styles. We use a two-dimensional classification 
strategy with control and data issues as the dominant organizing axes. We 
position the major styles within this space and use finer-grained 
discriminations to elaborate variations on the styles. This provides a 
framework for organizing  
design guidance 
, which we partially flesh out with 
rules of thumb.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
This paper presents two strategies for reducing the impact force resulting from the collision of a 
kinematically redundant manipulator with its environment, where it is assumed that the impact 
event has some finite duration. The first, an impact control strategy, involves adding torques to the 
joints of the redundant manipulator to impede motion into the environment with which it is colliding. The second, an impact planning strategy, involves choosing the configuration best suited for 
minimizing the impact force from an impact event, the approximate location of which is known 
ahead of time. Simulated results from both strategies are presented and discussed, and it is shown 
that both are successful in minimizing the impact force resulting from planned and unplanned collisions.  </abstract>

Digital interactive media augments interactive computing with video, audio, computer graphics and text, 
allowing multimedia presentations to be individually and dynamically tailored to the user. Multimedia, and 
particularly continuous media pose interesting problems for system designers, including those of latency 
and synchronization. These problems are especially evident when multimedia data is remote and must be 
accessed via networks. Latency and synchronization issues are discussed, and an integrated system, 
Tactus, is described. Tactus facilitates the implementation of interactive multimedia computer programs by 
managing latency and synchronization in the framework of an object-oriented graphical user interface 
toolkit.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The domain of applications that can be created with programming-by-demonstration 
(PBD) can be extended by improving the developers ability to communicate with the system. The 
techniques provided in this thesis will allow nonprogrammers to create a new variety of complete, 
interactive applications including many board games and educational software using PBD. 
A PBD software tool uses inferencing to induce programs by watching the developer demonstrate examples that show how the application should behave. Current systems reduce their scope 
or resort to having the developer program because they do not provide sufficient ways to express 
behaviors and the factors that affect them. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to develop understandable forms of annotated expression and manipulation that help a system infer a broader range 
of behavior. To test these ideas, this proposal introduces a new system called Gamut that will 
present the techniques in a unified software tool. 
The first technique replaces the macro recorder method for demonstrating behavior used 
in other PBD systems with a technique called nudges. The developer demonstrates by correcting 
the system at important points during program execution and also using two nudge commands to 
communicate important situations. First, the Do Something! nudge causes the system to reconsider 
past learned behavior and try to generalize its knowledge to fit the current situation. Using the 
Stop That! nudge will point out improper behavior and generate negative examples. 
Second, Gamut will use a new deck-of-playing-cards metaphor to express concepts such 
as randomness, sequencing, and data storage. By constructing an appropriate deck, shufing, sorting, and playing cards at key moments, developers can incorporate many effects not available without programming in other systems. 
Third, Gamut will improve communication about behaviors by making them more manipulable than in previous systems. Behaviors will be represented as small icons near the objects they 
affect. Using the familiar cut, copy, and paste commands, the developer can transfer behavior 
between objects. Determining how to make a behavior operate in the new context will be inferred 
automatically. An objects state from the recent past will be represented as temporal ghosts in 
which objects become dimmed, translucent images. Many sorts of behavior refer to prior states 
such as a previous position or an old property value. The ghost objects will allow the developer to 
make explicit connections. 
Finally, to reduce the number of options the system must explore, the developer will be 
able to give hints by highlighting important objects and properties. A new inferencing algorithm 
will be created that will take advantage of the hints. 
By combining these techniques, Gamut will provide a rich medium for expressing developer intentions, fostering greater communication between the PBD system and the developer and 
enabling the developer to create highly interactive software with minimal programming expertise.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract We introduce a new kind of language model, which models whole sentences or utterances directly using the Maximum Entropy 
paradigm. The new model is conceptually simpler, and more naturally 
suited to modeling whole-sentence phenomena, than the conditional ME 
models proposed to date. By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats 
each sentence or utterance as a "bag of features", where features are 
arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The model is unnor-malizable, but this does not interfere with training (done via sampling) 
or with use. Using the model is computationally straightforward. The 
main computational cost of training the model is in generating sample 
sentences from a Gibbs distribution. Interestingly, this cost has different dependencies, and is potentially lower, than in the comparable 
conditional ME model.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The large latency of memory accesses is a major obstacle in obtaining high processor utilization in large 
scale shared-memory multiprocessors. Although the provision of coherent caches in many recent machines 
has alleviated the problem somewhat, cache misses still occur frequently enough that they significantly lower 
performance. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of non-binding software-controlled prefetching, as 
proposed in the Stanford DASH Multiprocessor, to address this problem. The prefetches are non-binding in 
the sense that the prefetched data is brought to a cache close to the processor, but is still available to the cache 
coherence protocol to keep it consistent. Prefetching is software-controlled since the program must explicitly 
issue prefetch instructions. 
The paper presents results from detailed simulation studies done in the context of the Stanford DASH 
multiprocessor. Our results show that for applications with regular data access patterns|we evaluate a particle-based simulator used in aeronautics and an LU-decomposition application|prefetching can be very effective. 
It was easy to augment the applications to do prefetching and it increased their performance by 100-150% when 
we prefetched directly into the processor's cache. However, for applications with complex data usage patterns, 
prefetching was less successful. After much effort, the performance of a distributed-time logic simulation 
application that made extensive use of pointers and linked lists could be increased only by 30%. The paper 
also evaluates the effects of various hardware optimizations such as separate prefetch issue buffers, prefetching 
with exclusive ownership, lockup-free caches, and weaker memory consistency models on the performance of 
prefetching.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
To maximize the benefit and minimize the overhead of software-based latency tolerance techniques, 
we would like to apply them precisely to the set of 
dynamic references that suffer cache misses. Unfortunately, the information provided by the state-of-the-art cache miss profiling technique (summary profiling) 
is inadequate for references with intermediate miss 
ratios|it results in either failing to hide latency, or 
else inserting unnecessary overhead. To overcome this 
problem, we propose and evaluate a new technique| 
correlation profiling|which improves predictability by 
correlating the caching behavior with the associated dynamic context. Our experimental results demonstrate 
that roughly half of the 22 non-numeric applications 
we study can potentially enjoy significant reductions 
in memory stall time by exploiting at least one of the 
three forms of correlation profiling we consider.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain models of their environments. 
Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor 
environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate 
metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in 
large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much 
more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn 
and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly 
ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based 
and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive 
Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by 
partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach 
presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. 
The paper gives results for autonomous exploration, mapping and operation of a mobile 
robot in populated multi-room environments.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
World Wide Web electronic commerce applications 
often require consumers to enter private information (such as credit card numbers) into forms in the 
browser window. If third parties can insert trojan 
horse applications onto a consumer's machine, they 
can monitor keyboard strokes and steal private information. 
This paper outlines a simple way to accomplish 
this using Java or similar remote execution facilities. 
We implemented a simple version of this attack. We 
give a general method, window personalization, that 
can thwart or prevent this attack.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
We consider the usual Normal linear mixed model for "components of variance" from a Bayesian 
viewpoint. Instead of using Gibbs sampling or other Markov Chain schemes that rely on full 
conditional distributions, we propose and investigate a method for simulating from posterior distributions based on rejection sampling. The method applies with arbitrary prior distributions but 
we also employ as a default reference prior a version of Jeffreys's prior based on the integrated 
("restricted") likelihood. We demonstrate the ease of application and flexibility of this approach 
in several familiar settings, even in the presence of unbalanced data. A program implementing the 
algorithm discussed here will be available in the SAS MIXED procedure.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
A scheme to compute smoothing spline ANOVA estimates for large data sets with a (near) 
tensor-product structure is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and 
image analysis. This scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in 
order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various 
ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, 
are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An 
application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described.  </abstract>

<title> Uncovering Hidden Structure in Bond Futures Trading  </title>
<author> Fei CHEN , Stephen FIGLEWSKI , 
Jeffrey HEISLER zz , Andreas S. WEIGEND   </author>
<abstract> Abstract. This study uncovers trading styles in the transaction records of US Treasury bond futures. 
It uses transaction-by-transaction data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions' (CFTC) 
Computerized Trade Reconstruction (CTR) records. The data set consists of 30 million transaction| 
the complete US T-bond futures market for 3 years. Each transaction record consists of time (by the 
minute), price, volume, buy/sell, and an identifier of the specific account. 
We use statistical clustering techniques to group together trades that are similar. Two sets of 
assumptions have to be made: (1) What is a trade? We define a trade to begin when an account opens 
a position, and to end when its position size returns to zero. We describe each trade by several trade-specific variables (e.g., length of trade, maximum position size, opening move, long or short) and several 
exogenous, market-specific variables (e.g., price, volatility, trading volume). (2) What process generated 
the data? We assume a mixture of Gaussians. An observed trade is interpreted as a noisy realization of 
one of the mixture components. This paper assumes identity covariance matrices. Furthermore, each 
trade is fully assigned to a single cluster. We compare this approach to diagonal and to full covariance 
structure with probabilistic assignments. 
Trade profit was held back in the clustering process. It turns out that the clusters differ significantly in their profit and risk characteristics. Using conditional distributions, we summarize features 
of profitable trading styles and contrast them with losing strategies. We find that profitable styles tend 
to hold trades longer, trade at higher volatility, and trade earlier in the contracts. We also show how 
some clusters uncover "technical" traders. Using the information about the individual accounts, the 
assignments of accounts to clusters are described by entropy, and the transitions of a given account 
through clusters is modeled by a first order Markov model.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract. A knowledge-level analysis of complex tasks like diagnosis and design can give us a better understanding of these tasks in terms of the goals they 
aim to achieve and the different ways to achieve these goals. In this paper we 
present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of 
methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along 
which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign 
and developed a task-method structure for redesign. 
In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices 
and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between 
tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a problem-solving method, and the decomposition of a problem-solving method into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest 
to extend these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure, 
in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to its operationalization in terms of subtasks. Explicit representation 
of this kind of intermediate decisions helps to make and represent decisions in a 
more piecemeal fashion.  </abstract>

a typesafe language and installed dynamically into the 
operating system kernel. Because these protocols execute within the kernel, they can access the network

<abstract> Abstract: 
ATM networks will soon be moving from the experimental stage of test-beds to a commercial state 
where production networks are deployed and operated. The progress of ATM networks appears to be 
at risk due to the lack of a universal, open, and efficient ATM network control platform. The emerging 
Private Network to Network Interface (PNNI) standard introduces a control platform that can be used 
as an internetwork and possibly as an intra-network solution. However, the current PNNI still falls short 
in providing an acceptable universal solution, due to lack of performance optimizations for intra-network operation, limited functionality, and the lack of open interfaces for future functional extensions 
and services. 
OPENET is a common portable, open, and high-performance network control platform based on performance and functional enhancements to the PNNI standard. It is vendor-independent, scalable (in 
terms of network size and volume of calls), high-performance (in terms of call processing latency and 
throughput), and extensible (in terms of integrating customer-specific and value-added services). 
OPENET is designed as an extension to current PNNI so it can serve as a next generation PNNI. It is 
compatible with PNNI in the internetworking environment allowing large networks to be partitioned 
according to natural topological or organizational boundaries rather than the artificial use of internet-work interfaces at vendor boundaries. 
This report describes the OPENET architecture. The major novelties of the OPENET architecture compared to the current PNNI are: the use of native ATM switching for the dissemination of utilization 
updates; lightweight call setup; take down and modification signaling; a new signaling paradigm that 
better supports fast reservation and multicast services; and a rich signaling infrastructure that enables 
the development of augmented services (such as mobility, directory, etc.), leveraging the existing functions of the network control platform.  </abstract>

<title> Two Computer Systems Paradoxes: Serialize-to-Parallelize, 
and Queuing Concurrent-Writes  </title>
<author> Rimon Orni and Uzi Vishkin   </author>
<date> September 17, 1995  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
We present and examine the following Serialize-to-Parallelize Paradox: suppose a 
programmer has a parallel algorithm in mind; the programmer must serialize the algorithm, and is actually trained to suppress its parallelism, while writing code; later, 
however, compilation and runtime techniques are used to reverse the results of this serialization effort and extract as much parallelism as possible. This work actually provides 
examples where parallel or parallel-style code enables extracting more parallelism than 
standard serial code. 
The "arbitrary concurrent-write" convention is useful in parallel algorithms and programs and appears to be not too difficult to implement in hardware for serial machines. 
Still, typically concurrent-writes to the same memory location in a program are implemented by queuing the write operations, thus requiring time linear in the number of 
writes. We call this the Queuing Concurrent-Writes Paradox. 
Assuming that providing useful, easy-to-program programming paradigms to improve the overall effectiveness of computer systems is of interest, this work is a modest 
example for applying such software-driven considerations to computer architecture issues. This work may be the first to relate parallel algorithms and parallel programming 
with the technology of instruction level parallelism.  </abstract>

and measure their bearings relative to each other. Given such noisy input, the 
algorithm estimates the robot's position and orientation with respect to the 
map of the environment. The algorithm makes efficient use of our representation of the landmarks by complex numbers. The algorithm runs in time linear 
in the number of landmarks. We present results of simulations and propose 
how to use our method for robot navigation.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The problem of recognizing objects imaged in complex real-world scenes is examined from 
a parametric perspective using the theory of statistical estimation. A scalar measure of an 
object's complexity, which is invariant under affine transformation and changes in image noise 
level, is extracted from the object's Fisher information. The volume of Fisher information is 
shown to provide an overall statistical measure of the object's recognizability in a particular 
image, while the complexity provides an intrinsically physical measure that characterizes the 
object in any image. An information-conserving method is then developed for recognizing 
an object imaged in a complex scene. Here the term "information-conserving" means that 
the method uses all the measured data pertinent to the object's recognizability, attains the 
theoretical lower bound on estimation error for any unbiased estimate of the parameter vector 
describing the object, and therefore is statistically optimal. This method is then successfully 
applied to finding objects imaged in thousands of complex real-world scenes.  </abstract>

We have integrated the distributed search of genetic 
programming based systems with collective memory 
to form a collective adaptation search method. Such a 
system significantly improves search as problem complexity is increased. However, there is still considerable scope for improvement. In collective adaptation, search agents gather knowledge of their environment and deposit it in a central information repository. Process agents are then able to manipulate that 
focused knowledge, exploiting the exploration of the 
search agents. We examine the utility of increasing 
the capabilities of the centralized process agents.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
Users of digital image libraries are often not interested in image data per se but in derived 
products such as catalogs of objects of interest. Converting an image database into a usable 
catalog is typically carried out manually at present. For many larger image databases the 
purely manual approach is completely impractical. In this paper we describe the development 
of a trainable cataloging system: the user indicates the location of the objects of interest for 
a number of training images and the system learns to detect and catalog these objects in the 
rest of the database. In particular we describe the application of this system to the cataloging 
of small volcanoes in radar images of Venus. The volcano problem is of interest because of the 
scale (30,000 images, order of 1 million detectable volcanoes), technical difficulty (the variability 
of the volcanoes in appearance) and the scientific importance of the problem. The problem of 
uncertain or subjective ground truth is of fundamental importance in cataloging problems of this 
nature and is discussed in some detail. Experimental results are presented which quantify and 
compare the detection performance of the system relative to human detection performance. The 
paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the proposed system and the lessons learned of 
general relevance to the development of digital image libraries.  </abstract>

<title> Perfect Simulation of some Point Processes 
for the Impatient User  </title>
<author> Elke Thonnes  </author>
<affiliation> Department of Statistics, University of Warwick   </affiliation>
<date> February 9, 1998  </date>
<abstract> Abstract 
Recently Propp and Wilson [14] have proposed an algorithm, called 
Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which allows not only an approximate but perfect (i.e. exact) simulation of the stationary distribution 
of certain finite state space Markov chains. Perfect Sampling using 
CFTP has been successfully extended to the context of point processes, amongst other authors, by Haggstrom et al. [5]. In [5] Gibbs 
sampling is applied to a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres 
mixture model [19]. However, in general the running time of CFTP 
in terms of number of transitions is not independent of the state sampled. Thus an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a 
subtle bias, the user impatience bias. Fill [3] introduced an exact sampling algorithm for finite state space Markov chains which, in contrast 
to CFTP, is unbiased for user impatience. Fill's algorithm is a form 
of rejection sampling and similar to CFTP requires sufficient mono-tonicity properties of the transition kernel used. We show how Fill's 
version of rejection sampling can be extended to an infinite state space 
context to produce an exact sample of the penetrable spheres mixture 
process and related models. Following [5] we use Gibbs sampling and 
make use of the partial order of the mixture model state space. Thus  </abstract>

<abstract> A new notion of refinement for UNITY programs with local variables is defined. This 
notion is compositional in the following sense: programs can be refined in arbitrary contexts such that all unless and leadsto properties (i.e. temporal properties for both safety 
and progress) of the composition are preserved. The refinement notion is based on preservation of a new kind of UNITY-like property that takes into account the locality of 
variables. We do a small case study about registers.  </abstract>

<abstract> ABSTRACT Stepwise refinement of programs has proven to be a suitable 
method for developing parallel and distributed programs. We examine and compare a 
number of different notions of program refinement for Unity. Two of these notions are 
based on execution sequences. Refinement corresponds to the reduction of the set of execution sequences, i.e. reducing the amount of nondeterminism. The other refinement 
notions are based on Unity properties as introduced by Chandy and Misra. The Unity approach is to refine specifications. Although it has proven a suitable formalism for deriving 
algorithms, it seems less suitable for handling implementation details. Following Sanders 
and Singh, we formalize program refinement in the Unity framework as the preservation 
of Unity properties. We show that Unity properties are not powerful enough to characterize execution sequences. As a consequence, the notion of property-preserving refinement 
differs from the notion of reducing the set of execution sequences.  </abstract>

<abstract> Abstract 
The Internet, best known by most users as the WorldWide-Web, continues to expand at an amazing pace. We 
propose a new infrastructure to harness the combined resources, such as CPU cycles or disk storage, and make them 
available to everyone interested. This infrastructure has the 
potential for solving parallel supercomputing applications 
involving thousands of cooperating components. Our approach is based on recent advances in Internet connectivity 
and the implementation of safe distributed computing embodied in languages such as Java. 
We developed a prototype of a global computing infrastructure, called SuperWeb, that consists of hosts, brokers 
and clients. Hosts register a fraction of their computing resources (CPU time, memory, bandwidth, disk space) with 
resource brokers. Client computations are then mapped by 
the broker onto the registered resources. We examine an economic model for trading computing resources, and discuss 
several technical challenges associated with such a global 
computing environment.  </abstract>
