I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	cable
I-abstract	television
I-abstract	industry
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	integral
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	industry
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	United
I-abstract	States
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cable
I-abstract	television
I-abstract	industry
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	institutional
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	economic
I-abstract	determinants
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	growth
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	growth
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	subscribers
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cable
I-abstract	television
I-abstract	services
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	moderate
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	inception
I-abstract	until
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	late
I-abstract	1970
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	enjoyed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	period
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	substantial
I-abstract	gain
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	until
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	mid
I-abstract	-1980
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	subsequently
I-abstract	flattened
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	While
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	inconsistent
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	unfettered
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	nascent
I-abstract	industries
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	determinants
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	periods
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	growth
I-abstract	match
I-abstract	closely
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	developments
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	seemingly
I-abstract	boundless
I-abstract	demand
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	video
I-abstract	programming
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	technological
I-abstract	innovations
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	communication

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	technological
I-abstract	spillovers
I-abstract	from

I-abstract	changes

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	competitive
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	industry
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	ancillary
I-abstract	goal
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	also

I-abstract	These
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	chiefly
I-abstract	emphasise
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	engineering
I-abstract	product
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	problem

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	suggested
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	specialisation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	essential
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	branches
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	engineering
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	specialisations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Some
I-abstract	specialisations
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	arisen
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	notably
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	construction
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	More

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	short
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	forecast
I-abstract	errors
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	frequency
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	correlation
I-abstract	coefficients
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	countries
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	correlation
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	horizon
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	virtually
I-abstract	always
I-abstract	negative
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	short
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	horizon
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	typically
I-abstract	substantially
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Although
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	evidence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	positive
I-abstract	short
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	correlations
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	countries
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	choice
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	price
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	calculate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	covariances
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	VAR
I-abstract	forecast
I-abstract	errors
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	claims
I-abstract	made
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	literature
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	band

I-abstract	pass
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	isolate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	desired
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	not
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the

I-note	.
I-note	Injong
I-note	proposed
I-note	the
I-note	underlying
I-note	ideas
I-note	of
I-note	this
I-note	research
I-note	and
I-note	has
I-note	advised
I-note	me
I-note	on
I-note	all
I-note	aspects
I-note	of
I-note	it
I-note	.
I-note	He
I-note	pushed
I-note	me
I-note	to
I-note	work
I-note	hard
I-note	and
I-note	to
I-note	conduct
I-note	the
I-note	research

I-note	Some

I-note	has
I-note	surely

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	very

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	in

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	add
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	regulator
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	add
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	mean
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	operates
I-abstract	harmonically
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	feedback
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	role
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	add
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reject
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	sinusoidal
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	unknown
I-abstract	magnitude
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	phase
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	frequency
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	regulator
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	independent
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	feedback
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	plant
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Advantages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	follows
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	rejection
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	enhanced
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	turned
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	ofi
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	unwanted
I-abstract	transient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	digital
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(3)
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	perfect
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	rejection
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	just
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	disturbance
I-abstract	reduction
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(4)
I-abstract	Ability
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	perfect
I-abstract	rejection
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	preserved
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	uncertain
I-abstract	plant
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	optical
I-abstract	disc

I-abstract	conflrm

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	trying
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	paraphrases
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	Japanese
I-abstract	news
I-abstract	articles
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	Information
I-abstract	Extraction
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	focused
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fact
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	reported
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	article
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	differ
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	ent
I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	kinds
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	noun
I-abstract	phrases
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	names
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	dates
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	behave
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	anchors
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	unlikely
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	across
I-abstract	articles
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	anchors
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	comparable
I-abstract	articles
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	extract
I-abstract	portions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	share
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	anchors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	extract
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	convey
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Obtained
I-abstract	paraphrases
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	templates
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	stored
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	future
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	paraphrase
I-abstract	acquisition
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	divided
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	roughly
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	steps
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	explained
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	turn
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	encounter
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	texts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	coreference
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	restriction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	portions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	conclusions
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	neuroscience
I-abstract	considers
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	early
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	relates
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	statistics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Previous
I-abstract	studies
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	(
I-abstract	topography
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cells
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	understood
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	coding
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Here
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	extend
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	considering
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	responses
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	cells
I-abstract	could
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	coded
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	layer
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	leads
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	contour
I-abstract	coding
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	end
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	stopped
I-abstract	receptive
I-abstract	fields
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Interestingly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	contour
I-abstract	integration
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	seen

I-abstract	result
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	Each
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	thought
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	converts
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	coordinate
I-abstract	frame
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	independent
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	contents
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Second
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	scales
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	responses
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stock
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Previous
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	led
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	price
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	setting
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	achieved
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	practice
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	whereas
I-abstract	empirical
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	focused
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	heuristics
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	lack
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	justification
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	thesis
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	theoretically
I-abstract	justified
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	finance
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	flexible
I-abstract	enough
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	easily
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	incorporating
I-abstract	modules
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	considerations
I-abstract	like

I-abstract	risk
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	competition
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	experimentally
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	artificial
I-abstract	markets
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	parameter

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	reasonable

I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	emerge
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	spread
I-abstract	increases
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	uncertainty
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	true
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stock
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	spreads
I-abstract	tend
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	volatile
I-abstract	markets
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	lower
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	spreads
I-abstract	perform
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	environments
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	competitive
I-abstract	market
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	makers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	article
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	despite
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	decades
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	research
I-abstract	characterizing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	properties

I-abstract	neurons
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	picture
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	V
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	really
I-abstract	operates
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	neurons
I-abstract	represents
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	scenes
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	realistic
I-abstract	viewing
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	five
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	current
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	stem
I-abstract	largely
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	biases
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	contributions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	linearities
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	understood
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	open
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	window
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	theories
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	proposals
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	appearance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	depends
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	viewpoint
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	observed
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	light
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	illuminated
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	appearance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	never
I-abstract	identical
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	always
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	distinguished
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	recognized
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	arises
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	What
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	consider
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	light
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	attached
I-abstract	shadows
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	pixel
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Lambertian
I-abstract	reflectance
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	illuminated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	light
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	infinity
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	polyhedral
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	IR
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dimension
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	equals
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	distinct
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	normals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	constructed
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	properly
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	pixel
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	reflectance
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	seen
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	IR
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	immediately
I-abstract	suggest
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Throughout
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	offer
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	demonstrating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	empirical
I-abstract	validity
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	illumination
I-abstract	cone
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	protocol

I-abstract	over
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	by

I-abstract	even

I-abstract	passphrases
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	offers

I-abstract	Finally

I-abstract	equivalent
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	introduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	LOTOS
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	OSI
I-abstract	95
I-abstract	Enhanced
I-abstract	Transport
I-abstract	Service
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	discusses
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	encountered
I-abstract	during
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	writing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ones
I-abstract	caused
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	validation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lack
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	Timed
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	LOTOS
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	But
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interest
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	itself
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	lies
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	specification

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	its

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	simulate
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	Therefore

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	corrupted
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	scalar
I-abstract	quantization
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Adaptivity
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	compression
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	statistics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	are
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	priori
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	quantized
I-abstract	samples
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	quantization
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	backward
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	separated
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	namely
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	changing
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	redesign
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	standard
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	smoothness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	various
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	argue
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wide
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	sources
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	smooth
I-abstract	probability

I-abstract	(

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	approximation
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	quantizer
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	approximation
I-abstract	becoming
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	increases
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how

I-abstract	The
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	deals
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	considers
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	learners
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	classes
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analyzes
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Turing
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	degrees
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	containing
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	least
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	no
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	outside
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	learner
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	Turing
I-abstract	degree
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inclusion
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	recursively
I-abstract	enumerable
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sense
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	learner
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	Turing
I-abstract	degree
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	computable
I-abstract	universal
I-abstract	learner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	upper
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	grammar
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	oracle
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	sufficient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concepts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	gives
I-abstract	insufficient
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	criteria
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	restrictive
I-abstract	convergence
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	jump
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	itself
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	So
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	infinite
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	index
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	according
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	HIV
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	primarily
I-abstract	spread
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	highly
I-abstract	infectious
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	superspreaders
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	staged
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	progression
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	every
I-abstract	infected
I-abstract	individual
I-abstract	goes
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	series
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	infection
I-abstract	stages
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	virus
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	primarily
I-abstract	spread
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	individuals
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	or
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	late
I-abstract	stages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	disease
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	importance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	choosing
I-abstract	appropriate
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	distributing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	subgroups
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	minimize
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	"
I-abstract	cial
I-abstract	transients
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	unbalanced
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	removal
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	yet
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	neglected
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	!ect.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	importance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	distinguishing
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	partners
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	person
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	contacts
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	partner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	assuming
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	people
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	partners
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	fewer
I-abstract	contacts
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	partner
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	people
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	few
I-abstract	partners
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	found
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	epidemic
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	sensitive
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	partner
I-abstract	acquisition
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	might
I-abstract	expect
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	transmission
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	HIV
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	contact
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	sensitive
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	per
I-abstract	partner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Modeling
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	distinction
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	particularly
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	estimating
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	proposals
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	media
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	demand
I-abstract	servers
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	effectively
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	clients
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	share
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	clients
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	clients
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	partitioned
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	\sync-classes"
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	clients
I-abstract	who
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	serviced
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	allocation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	may

I-abstract	into

I-abstract	classes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	functions
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	determine
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	choose
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	compute
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	optimal

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	plug
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	cost

I-abstract	whatsoever
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	satisfies
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	axioms
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	-
I-abstract	antees
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	tailored
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	meet
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	twin
I-abstract	challenges
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	scalability
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	flexibility
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	consistency
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	leases
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	lease
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	proxies
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	leases
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	scalable
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	CDNs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Further
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	employs
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	multicast
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	notifications
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	proxies
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	scalable
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	implement
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Apache
I-abstract	web
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	its

I-abstract	using

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	emphasis
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	symmetries
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	distinguish
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	horizontal

I-abstract	which
I-abstract	preserve
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	direction
I-abstract	lead

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	loop
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	some

I-abstract	hold
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relative
I-abstract	equilibrium

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	annotating
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	approaches

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	human

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	understand
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	molecular
I-abstract	machinery
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cell
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	know
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	multitude
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cell
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	High
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	throughput
I-abstract	technologies
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	fairly
I-abstract	noisy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	predicting
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	could
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	signiOEcant
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	One
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	predicting
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	silico
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	produce
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	OErst
I-abstract	principles
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	detailed
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	candidate
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	take
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	alternative
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	employing
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	relatively
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	learns
I-abstract	dynamically
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	collection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	attraction
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	repulsion
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	pair
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	proteins
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	represented
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sum
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	attractive
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	repulsive
I-abstract	forces
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	sized
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	along

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	reduce
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	microrotations
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	incorporate
I-abstract	radix

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	achieving
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	reduction
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	microrotations

I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	separated
I-abstract	rotators
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	incorporated
I-abstract	additional

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reduce
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	factor
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	pipelined
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	easily
I-abstract	integrated
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	due

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	As

I-abstract	Information
I-abstract	Society
I-abstract	develops
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	attempts

I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	groups
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	benefits
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	obstructing
I-abstract	their

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	some

I-abstract	drawn
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	assume

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	inferential
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	abductive
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Inference
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	best
I-abstract	explanation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	semantic
I-abstract	paths
I-abstract	produced

I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	linguistic
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	controlled
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	intrinsic
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	devised
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	plausible
I-abstract	semantic
I-abstract	relation

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	inferred
I-abstract	whenever
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	collide
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	trajectories
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	colliding
I-abstract	markers
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	abductive
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	marker
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	stands
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	implication
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Markers
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	semantic
I-abstract	constrains
I-abstract	throughout
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	evaluating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	plausibility
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	inference
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	base
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	inferential

I-abstract	at
I-abstract	producing
I-abstract	interpretations
I-abstract	accountable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	commonsense
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	novelty
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Animals
I-abstract	possess
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	evolved
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	handle
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	organism
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Likewise
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	controlled
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	fundamental
I-abstract	difference
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	arise
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	fails
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	call
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	exploratory
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	investigate
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	--
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	escaping
I-abstract	behavioral
I-abstract	stasis
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	escaping
I-abstract	behavioral
I-abstract	cycles
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	finding
I-abstract	food
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	chemotaxis
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	containing
I-abstract	obstacles
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	describing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Exploratory
I-abstract	Behavior
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	interested
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	providing
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ability
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	unexpected
I-abstract	events
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Animals
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	repertoire
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	unlike
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	animals
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	dealing
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interactions
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	call
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	exploratory
I-abstract	behaviors
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	would
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	questions
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	would
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	regard
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	exploratory
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	1.
I-abstract	How
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	you
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	failed
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	2.
I-abstract	Once
I-abstract	routine
I-abstract	behavior
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	failed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	what
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	you
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	explore
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	actions
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	3.
I-abstract	How
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	you
I-abstract	learn
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	actions
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	--
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	requiring

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	Mind
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	boggling
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	EDA
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	necessitates
I-abstract	reuse
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	intellectual
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	commercial
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	academic
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	nature
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tool
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	remains
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	ill
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	defined
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	formally
I-abstract	specified
I-abstract	functions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	interfaces
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	EDA
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	evolve
I-abstract	rapidly
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	fit
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	manufacturing
I-abstract	contexts
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	created
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	circuit
I-abstract	designers
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	leads
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	moving
I-abstract	targets
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	CAD
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	developers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Yet
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	uneconomical
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	write
I-abstract	off
I-abstract	tool
I-abstract	reuse
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	simply
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	endemic
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	message
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	CAD
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	planned
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	reusable
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	glue
I-abstract	code
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	implies
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	industrial
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	academic
I-abstract	research
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	focus
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	formulating
I-abstract	practical
I-abstract	tool
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	interfaces
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	implementing
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	(3)
I-abstract	performing
I-abstract	detailed
I-abstract	evaluations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	While
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	reminiscent
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	reuse
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	EDA
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	stand
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	alone
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	interface
I-abstract	through

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	Bayesian
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	insight
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	modeled
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	conjunction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	themselves
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	CFR
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	unique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	reasons
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	broadly
I-abstract	applicable
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wide
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	constructing
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	easy
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	capable
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	identity
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	computationally
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	requiring
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	propor
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	tional
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	edge
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	CFR
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	experience
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	contains
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	edge
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	correspondences
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	CFR
I-abstract	takes
I-abstract	advantage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Oriented
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	eliminate
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	difficulties
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	face
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	insensitive
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	gross
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	direction
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	facial
I-abstract	expression
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Taking
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	consider
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	pixel
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	coordinate
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	take
I-abstract	advantage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	observation
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	face
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	varying
I-abstract	illumina
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	tion
I-abstract	direction
I-abstract	lie
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	3-D
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	face
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Lambertian
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	shadowing
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	since
I-abstract	faces
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	truly
I-abstract	Lambertian
I-abstract	surfaces
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	indeed
I-abstract	produce
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	shadowing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	deviate
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	explicitly
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	deviation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	discounts
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	regions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	face
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	deviation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	projection
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	Fisher's
I-abstract	Linear
I-abstract	Discriminant
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	separated
I-abstract	classes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	severe
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	lighting
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	facial
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	Eigenface
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	linearly
I-abstract	projecting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	requirements
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Yet
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extensive
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	\Fisherface"
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	involved
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	producing
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	mosaics
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	unclear

I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	evidence
I-abstract	suggests
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	involved
I-abstract	[

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	extend
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	neurite
I-abstract	outgrowth
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow

I-abstract	Starting
I-abstract	from

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	cells

I-abstract	ganise

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	Our

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Two
I-abstract	paradigms
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	top
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	down
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	starting
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	bottom
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	little
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	assumed
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	explore
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	bottom
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	operators
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	classify
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	contain
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	cues
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	occlusion
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	transparency
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	bends
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Like
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	human
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	begin
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	directions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	create
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filter
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	orientation
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	describing
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	combination
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	basis
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filtering
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	call
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	offers
I-abstract	advantages
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	computation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	variety
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	quadrature
I-abstract	pairs
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	measure
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	orientation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	texture
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	enhancement
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	steerable
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	post
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	filter
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	orientations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	detector
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	maxima
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	contour
I-abstract	phases
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	maxima
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	compare
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	respond
I-abstract	selectively
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	\T",
I-abstract	\L",
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	\X"
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	T
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	X
I-abstract	junctions
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	indicate
I-abstract	occlusion
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	transparency
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	respectively
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	detectors
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	cues
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	built
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	filters
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	energy
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	resemble
I-abstract	responses
I-abstract	found
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	visual
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	junction
I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	salient
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	combine
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	contour
I-abstract	detector
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	saliency
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Shashua
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Ullman
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	finds
I-abstract	visually
I-abstract	salient
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	descriptive
I-abstract	power
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	include
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	competitive
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	From
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	configuration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	saliencies
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	detectors
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	respond
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cues
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	occlusion
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	transparency
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	bending
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	saliency
I-abstract	values
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	curve
I-abstract	linking
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	along
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	contours
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	synthetic
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	complicated
I-abstract	scenes
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	why
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Each
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	calculations
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	throughout
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	assumes
I-abstract	little
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	intelligent
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	able
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	pursue
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	rational
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	experimentally
I-abstract	evaluates
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	conflict
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	limited
I-abstract	resources
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	X-JACK
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	extension
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	JACK
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	art
I-abstract	agent
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	toolkit
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	X-JACK
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	classify
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	conflicts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	compare
I-abstract	X-JACK
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	JACK
I-abstract	experimentally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	stress
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	conflict
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	conflicts
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reason
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	benefit
I-abstract	however
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	noticeable
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	statistically
I-abstract	significant
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	conflict
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	relatively
I-abstract	small

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	hinges
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	geodesic
I-abstract	distance
I-abstract	equation
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	embedded
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	represents
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	geometrical
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	D
I-abstract	surfaces
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hypersurface
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	4-
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	herein
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	generalization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	geodesic

I-abstract	method
I-abstract	introduced

I-abstract	R. 
I-abstract	Kimmel
I-abstract	et
I-abstract	al
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	generalizes
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	D
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	4
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	Eulerian
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	formulation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	geodesic
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	leading
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	numer
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	ical
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	partial
I-abstract	differential
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	originating
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	hyperbolic
I-abstract	conservation
I-abstract	laws
I-abstract	[

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	has
I-abstract	proven
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	stable
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	showing
I-abstract	both

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	No
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	sample
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	sufficient
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	determine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	therefore
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	entropy
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	signal
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Some
I-abstract	assumption
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	either
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	functional
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	smoothness
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Both
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	functions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	By
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	differential
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	rule
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	EMMA
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	optimizes
I-abstract	entropy
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	kernel
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	estimation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Entropy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	derivative
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	calculated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	sampling
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	update
I-abstract	rule
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	surprisingly
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	EMMA
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	detect
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	correct
I-abstract	corruption
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	magnetic
I-abstract	resonance
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	MRI
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	beyond
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	scope
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	entropy
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	empirical
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	include
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	lower
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tighter

I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	done
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	effect
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	duplicate
I-abstract	keys
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	addressed
I-abstract	analytically
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	practice
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	oversampling
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	undersampling
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	introduced
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	analyzed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Empirically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	four
I-abstract	diverse
I-abstract	MIMD
I-abstract	architectures
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	On
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	machines
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	random
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	generated
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	achieves
I-abstract	good

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not

I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	sorting
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	any

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	But
I-abstract	PSRS
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wide
I-abstract	spectrum
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	machines
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	any

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	integrated
I-abstract	modelling
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	digital
I-abstract	designs
I-abstract	consisting
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	modelling
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	capture
I-abstract	designs
I-abstract	during
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	synthesis
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	behavioural
I-abstract	specification
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modelling
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	/

I-abstract	codesign
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	built
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	includes
I-abstract	procedures
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	Navigating
I-abstract	through

I-abstract	not
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	become
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	orientation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	hyperdocument
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	showing

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	mainly
I-abstract	details

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	designers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	goal
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	build
I-abstract	graphical
I-abstract	browsers
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	compositions
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	concepts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	nested
I-abstract	composite
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	showing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	importance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	navigation
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	guide
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	hyperspace
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	proposal
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	navigation
I-abstract	browser
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	extends
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fisheye
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	strategy
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	nested
I-abstract	compositions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	outline
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	browser
I-abstract	illustrating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ideas
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Lastly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	major
I-abstract	characteristics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	hypermedia
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	This
I-abstract	short
I-abstract	note
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	constructive
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	monotone
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	complementarity
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	)

I-abstract	(

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	monotone
I-abstract	LCP
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	was

I-abstract	by
I-abstract	Kojima
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	Shindoh
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	an
I-abstract	SDP
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	semidefinite

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	gives
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	negative
I-abstract	answer

I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	define
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	subspace
I-abstract	angles
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	ARMA
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	principal
I-abstract	angles
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	column
I-abstract	spaces
I-abstract	generated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	observability
I-abstract	matrices
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	observability
I-abstract	matrices
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inverse
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	angles
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	calculated
I-abstract	via
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	observability
I-abstract	Gramians
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	concatenations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	inverses
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	relation
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	distance
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	ARMA
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Most
I-abstract	attention
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	paid
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	recently
I-abstract	defined
I-abstract	metric
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	ARMA
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cepstra
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	involved
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Weight
I-abstract	modifications
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	traditional
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	nets
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	computed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	hard
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	wired
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Without
I-abstract	exception
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	limitations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Is
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	principle
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	overcome
I-abstract	limitations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	hard
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	wired
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	allowing
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	nets
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	own
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	constructively
I-abstract	demonstrates
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	principle
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	`yes'.
I-abstract	I
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	gradient
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	`self-referential'
I-abstract	recurrent
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	`speak'
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	own
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	activations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	units
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	observing
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	own
I-abstract	errors
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	explicitly
I-abstract	analyzing
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	modifying
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	own
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	responsible
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	analyzing
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	modifying
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	`introspective'
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	net
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	own
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	parameters
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	disadvantage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	step
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	independent
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	length
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	equals
I-abstract	O
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	conn
I-abstract	logn
I-abstract	conn
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	conn
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	connections
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Another
I-abstract	disadvantage
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	minima
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	unusually
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	surface
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	however
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	come
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	`introspective'
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	`self-referential'
I-abstract	weight
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	RML
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	programming
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	intended
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Natural
I-abstract	Semantics
I-abstract	specifications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	procedural
I-abstract	elements
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	relations
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	mappings
I-abstract	defined
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	axioms
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	inference
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	flow
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	logical
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	unification
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	Prolog
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	ML
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	borrows
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	polymorphic
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	facility
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	separately
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	compilable
I-abstract	modules
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	prototype
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	translating
I-abstract	RML
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	Continuation
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Passing
I-abstract	Style
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	C
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Benchmarks
I-abstract	indicate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	code
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	orders
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	magnitude
I-abstract	faster
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	Typol
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	times
I-abstract	faster
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	standard

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	vector
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	concerns
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	partitioning
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	vectors
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	d

I-abstract	into
I-abstract	p
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	maximize
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	c
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sum
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	each

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Here
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	parameters
I-abstract	d
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	p
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	n
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjacency
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	vertices
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	polytopes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	adjacency
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	polytopes
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	able
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	vector
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	runs

I-abstract	(

I-abstract	)
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	O
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	L
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	q
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	polynomial
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	L
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	v
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	vertices
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	polytope
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	sensitive
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	enumerating
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	vertices
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	polytope
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	adjacency
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	implies
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	polynomial
I-abstract	upper
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	combinatorial
I-abstract	diameter
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	polytopes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	establish
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	partition
I-abstract	polytope
I-abstract	analogue
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lower
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	theorem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	indicating
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	output
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	sensitive
I-abstract	enumeration
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	superior

I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	activities
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	constructing
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	soft
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	ware
I-abstract	product
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Many
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	actions
I-abstract	mentioned
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	supported
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	repository

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	create

I-abstract	manipulate
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	generate
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	etc
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	deliverables
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	tailored
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	necessary
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	planed
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	respect
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	existing

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	repositories
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	database
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	events
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	triggering
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	corres
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	ponding

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	days
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	propositional
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	quite
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	understood
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Good
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	wealth
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	sometimes
I-abstract	challenging
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	STRIPS
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	style
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	best
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	benchmark
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	established
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	propositional
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	major
I-abstract	drawback
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	formalism
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	too
I-abstract	weak
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	easy
I-abstract	encoding
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	genuinely
I-abstract	interesting
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	specifically
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	involving
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	enhance
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	PDDL
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cope
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	additions
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	numerical
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	third
I-abstract	international
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	competition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	increased
I-abstract	interest
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	contribution
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	STRIPS
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	numbers
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	introduction
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	numerical
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	undecidable
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	thereof
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	identify
I-abstract	special
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	decidability
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	overview
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	research
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	generalized

I-abstract	complementarity
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	indicate
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Generalized
I-abstract	LCP
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	analyze
I-abstract	piecewise
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	resistive
I-abstract	electrical
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Next
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Extended
I-abstract	LCP
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	fundamental
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	arise
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	max
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	algebraic
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	appear
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	Since
I-abstract	hybrid

I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	event

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	leads
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	LCPs
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	play
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	role
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Building
I-abstract	upon
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	quantifier
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	LOGCFL
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	lay
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	groundwork
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	deeper
I-abstract	investigation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	examine
I-abstract	subclasses
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	LOGCFL
I-abstract	arising
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	varying
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	arity
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	nesting
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	groupoidal
I-abstract	quantifiers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	extends
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	elaborate
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	relating
I-abstract	monoidal
I-abstract	quantifiers
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	NC
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	subclasses
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	absence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	BIT
I-abstract	predicate
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	resolve
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	no
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	outermost
I-abstract	unary
I-abstract	groupoidal
I-abstract	quantifier
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	FO
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	capture
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	context
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	free
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	obtain
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	surprising
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	variant
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Greibach's
I-abstract	\hardest
I-abstract	context
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	free
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	LOGCFL
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	complete
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	quantifier
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	free
I-abstract	BIT
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	free
I-abstract	reductions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	FO
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	unary
I-abstract	groupoidal
I-abstract	quantifiers
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	strictly
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	expressive
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	BIT
I-abstract	predicate
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Considering
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	groupoidal
I-abstract	quantifier
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	logic
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	majority
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	pairs
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	strictly
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	expressive
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	majority
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	individuals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technical
I-abstract	tool
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	independent
I-abstract	interest
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	define
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	aperiodic
I-abstract	nondeterministic
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	automaton
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	FO
I-abstract	translations
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	precisely
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	mappings
I-abstract	computed

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	past
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	presented
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	solve
I-abstract	ordered
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on

I-abstract	using
I-abstract	standard

I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	herewith
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	transform
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	inequalities
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	integers
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	comparators
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	equivalent
I-abstract	ordered
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	proven
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	transforming
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	ordered
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	ordinary
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	algebraic
I-abstract	equalities
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	inequalities
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	integer
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	soluble
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	solvers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	At
I-abstract	last
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	modifications
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	simplifications
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	hierarchies
I-abstract	improving
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	practical
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	job
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	shop
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	modifications
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	combinations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	consecutive
I-abstract	hierarchy
I-abstract	levels
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	priorities
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	weights
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	simplifications
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	incomplete
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	improvements
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	(1)

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	enhanced
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	capable
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	accurate
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	D
I-abstract	interaction
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	found
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	literature
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	summarized
I-abstract	here

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	has
I-abstract	proven
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Several

I-abstract	at

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	TBDD's
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	considerably
I-abstract	enlarges
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Boolean
I-abstract	functions
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	manipulated
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	OBDD's
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	done
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	applying
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	transformations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	mathematics
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	physics
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	technical
I-abstract	sciences
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	BDD
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	Boolean
I-abstract	function

I-abstract	CAD
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	Instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	working
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	OBDDrepresentation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	f
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	TBDD's
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	OBDD
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	suited
I-abstract	cube
I-abstract	transformed
I-abstract	version
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	f
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Besides
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	giving
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	insights
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	investigate
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	detail
I-abstract	cube
I-abstract	transformations
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	complete
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	*
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	TBDD
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	similarly
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	OBDD
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	*
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	evidence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	practical
I-abstract	importance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	such

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	we

I-abstract	begun

I-abstract	NLG
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	these

I-abstract	are
I-abstract	brought

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	gives
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	informal
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	what
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	coherence
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	focus
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	patient
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	leaflets
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	follow
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	content
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	expressed
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	plain
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	formatted
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	pictures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	finally
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	dialogue
I-abstract	script
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	animated
I-abstract	agents
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	meaning
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	mapped
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	realisation
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	media
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	expanded
I-abstract	options
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	expressing
I-abstract	meaning
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	perceived
I-abstract	style
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	tone
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	presentation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Throughout
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	stress
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	extra
I-abstract	media
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	added
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	text
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	integrated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	formatting
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	pictures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	require

I-abstract	are
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	repeated
I-abstract	across

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Detection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	motifs
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	molecule
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	formulate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	target
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	matches
I-abstract	vis
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	vis
I-abstract	partial
I-abstract	matches
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	precise
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	minimized
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	metrics
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	evaluating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	partial
I-abstract	matches
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Secondly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	polynomial
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	given
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	target
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	secondary
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	annotate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	points
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	motif
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	target
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	thus
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	guarantees
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	perfect
I-abstract	match
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Even
I-abstract	otherwise
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	computes
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	matches
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Unlike
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	minimized
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	translates
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	root
I-abstract	mean
I-abstract	square
I-abstract	deviation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	RMSD
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	accepted
I-abstract	metric
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	matching
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	biological

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	preprocessing
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	suitable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	detection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	motifs
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	matches

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	article
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	methodology
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modular
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	redundant
I-abstract	manipulators
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	improved
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	modularity
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	special
I-abstract	decomposition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	manageable
I-abstract	subproblems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	decomposition
I-abstract	corresponds
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	division
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	redundant
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	redundant
I-abstract	macro
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	mini
I-abstract	substructures
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	designed
I-abstract	separately
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	substructures
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	recently
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	characterizations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	end
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	effector
I-abstract	inertial
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	acceleration
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	treat
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	angular
I-abstract	motion
I-abstract	separately
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	homogeneities
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	differences
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	units
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	highly
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	aspect
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	characteristics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	methodology
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	illustrated
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Caching
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	popular
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	load
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	response
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	interested
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	caching
I-abstract	might
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	effective
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	engines
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	engine
I-abstract	traces
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	examining
I-abstract	query
I-abstract	locality
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	implications
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	caching
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	trace
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	Queries
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	significant
I-abstract	locality
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	query
I-abstract	frequency
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Zipf
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Very
I-abstract	popular
I-abstract	queries
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	shared
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	cached
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	servers
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	proxies
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	while
I-abstract	16
I-abstract	%
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	22
I-abstract	%
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	queries
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	same
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	cached
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	side
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Multiple
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	word
I-abstract	queries
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	shared
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	cached
I-abstract	mainly
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	side
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	caching
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	done
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	side
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	short
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	term
I-abstract	caching
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	hours
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	enough
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	cover
I-abstract	query
I-abstract	temporal
I-abstract	locality
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	while
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	proxy
I-abstract	caching
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	longer
I-abstract	periods
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	days
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(3)
I-abstract	Most
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	lexicons
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	submitting
I-abstract	queries
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Frequent
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	who
I-abstract	submit
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	search
I-abstract	requests
I-abstract	tend
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reuse
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	subset

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	sparse
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	bandwidth
I-abstract	reduction
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	addressed
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	solved
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	suitable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	symmetric
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	symmetric
I-abstract	matrices
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	former
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	constructive
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	latter
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	metaheuristic
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	heuristic
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	parallel
I-abstract	machines
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Both
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	literature
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	suited
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	symmetric
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Benchmarks
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	industrial
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	superior
I-abstract	effectiveness
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	efficiency
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	one

I-abstract	searchers
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	move
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	evaders
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	goal
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	To

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	website
I-abstract	means
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	manipulated
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	anywhere
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	24
I-abstract	hours
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	day
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	respond
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	requests
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	people
I-abstract	located
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	zones
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	periods
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	constant
I-abstract	supervision
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	concerned
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	truly
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	takes
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	integrates
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	coherent
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	autonomously
I-abstract	run
I-abstract	tours
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	recharge
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	batteries
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	required
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Significant
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	made
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	allow
I-abstract	successful
I-abstract	integration
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	localisation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	generously
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	Carnegie
I-abstract	Mellon
I-abstract	University
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Robotic
I-abstract	Systems
I-abstract	Lab
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Fine
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	tuning
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	localisation
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	suit
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	building
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	An
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	final
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	adds
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	High
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Level
I-abstract	Controller
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	complete
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	seamless
I-abstract	integration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	localisation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	recharging
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	controlling
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Long
I-abstract	term
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	capable
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	running
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	days
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	human
I-abstract	intervention
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	142
I-abstract	hours
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	continuous
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	achieved
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	maximum
I-abstract	stretch
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	36
I-abstract	hours
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	no
I-abstract	human
I-abstract	intervention
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Experiments
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	illustrated
I-abstract	weaknesses
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	appear
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	outperformed
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	builds
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	New
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	interface
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	identified
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	highlighting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	continuous
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	autonomy
I-abstract	poses
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	entire
I-abstract	robotics
I-abstract	community
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	According
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	published
I-abstract	literature
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	project
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	achieved
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	longest
I-abstract	ever
I-abstract	continuous
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	web

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	D
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	genus

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	represented
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	spherical
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	nearly
I-abstract	uniform
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	connectivity
I-abstract	among
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	forward
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	intrinsic
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	invariant
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	rigid
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	factor
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	regularity
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inverse
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	always
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	recovered
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	iterative
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	synthesizing
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	becomes
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	interpolating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distributions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interpolated
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	back
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	D
I-abstract	morph
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distance
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	distributions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	quantitatively
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	synthesis
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	yeild
I-abstract	smooth
I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	migration
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Experiments
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	smooth
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	realistic
I-abstract	shape
I-abstract	morphs

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	involving

I-abstract	spatial

I-abstract	faces
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	difficulties
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	latent

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	candidate

I-abstract	be

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Second
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	evaluating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fit
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	competing
I-abstract	statistical
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	voter
I-abstract	choice
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	complicated
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	realized
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	precisely
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	argue
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	confirmatory
I-abstract	factor
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	mass
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	issue
I-abstract	preference
I-abstract	questions
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	attractive
I-abstract	means
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	measuring
I-abstract	voter
I-abstract	ideal
I-abstract	points
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	party
I-abstract	issue
I-abstract	positions
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	recovered
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	strategy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	go
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	assessing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fit
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	competing
I-abstract	statistical
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	multinomial
I-abstract	logit
I-abstract	vs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	multinomial
I-abstract	probit
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	competing
I-abstract	explanations
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	spatial
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	vs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	theories
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	voting
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	sociological
I-abstract	theories
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	demonstrate
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Bayesian
I-abstract	perspective
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	advantages
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	fitting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	multinomial
I-abstract	probit
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	facilitates
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	comparison
I-abstract	mentioned
I-abstract	above
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Results
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Netherlands
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Denmark
I-abstract	suggest
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	multinomial
I-abstract	probit
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	disregarded
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	decision
I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	multinomial
I-abstract	probit
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	MNP
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	multinomial
I-abstract	logit
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	MNL
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	clear

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	brief
I-abstract	review
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	various
I-abstract	aspects
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	prospective

I-abstract	/

I-abstract	/
I-abstract	molecular
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	integrated
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	basic
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	combine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	advantages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	dominating
I-abstract	CMOS
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	exibility
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	fabrication
I-abstract	yield
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	electron
I-abstract	molecular
I-abstract	devices
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	nanometer
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	footprint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	devices
I-abstract	would
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	assembled
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	fabricated
I-abstract	nanowire
I-abstract	array
I-abstract	fabric
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	enabling
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	acceptable
I-abstract	fabrication
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Preliminary
I-abstract	estimates
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	devices
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	12
I-abstract	cm
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	unparalleled
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	20
I-abstract	operations
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	cm
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	per
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	acceptable
I-abstract	power
I-abstract	consumption
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	below
I-abstract	10
I-abstract	W
I-abstract	/
I-abstract	cm
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	imposes
I-abstract	substantial
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	importantly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	high
I-abstract	defect
I-abstract	tolerance
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	circuit
I-abstract	architectures
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	plausible
I-abstract	flrst
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	probably
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	embedded
I-abstract	memories
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	stand
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	alone
I-abstract	terabit
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	chips
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Boolean
I-abstract	logic
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	problematic
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	though
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	options
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	explored
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	CMOL
I-abstract	technology
I-abstract	seems
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	uniquely
I-abstract	suitable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	crossbar
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	CrossNet
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	neuromorphic
I-abstract	networks
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	advanced
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	processing
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	least
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	classiflcation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	quite
I-abstract	possibly
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	Lagrangian
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which

I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	determined
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	involving
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	operator
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	original
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	unconstrained
I-abstract	max
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	min
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	evaluated
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	average
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	max
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	min
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	implies
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	original
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	fine
I-abstract	grid
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	approximated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	coarser
I-abstract	grid
I-abstract	followed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	interpolation
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fine
I-abstract	grid
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approximation
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	optimized
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	choice
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	boundary
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	adjoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	selecting
I-abstract	he
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stabilization
I-abstract	parameter
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	Hierarchical
I-abstract	Bounds
I-abstract	Method
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	illustrated
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	convection
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	diffusion
I-abstract	equation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	sharp
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	second
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	purely
I-abstract	convective
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	discretized
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Taylor
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Galerkin
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	third
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Euler
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	nozzle
I-abstract	flow
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	reduced
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	nonlinear
I-abstract	scalar
I-abstract	continuous
I-abstract	equation
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	nonlinear
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	equations
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	Taylor
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Galerkin
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	solved
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Newton
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Raphson
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	linearized
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computed
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	obtain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linear
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	produce
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	last
I-abstract	chapter
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Domain
I-abstract	Decomposition
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	introduced
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	decomposed
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	subdomains
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	solved
I-abstract	separately
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	continuity
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	boundaries
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	imposed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	allowing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bounds
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	parallelized
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	sparse
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	inversion
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	O
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	N
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	Domain
I-abstract	Decomposition
I-abstract	becomes
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dimensional
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	divided
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	we
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	start
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	developing
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	covering

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	K
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	by
I-abstract	architectural
I-abstract	awareness
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	To

I-abstract	adaptation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	K
I-abstract	incorporates
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	reflective
I-abstract	middleware
I-abstract	layer
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	customization

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	consider
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	automatically
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	traffic
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	city
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Such
I-abstract	automatic
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	efficiency
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	decreasing
I-abstract	delays
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	increasing
I-abstract	capacity
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	easing
I-abstract	congestion
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	thought
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	belonging
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	layer
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	corresponding
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	responsible
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	generating
I-abstract	timed
I-abstract	trajectories
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	individual
I-abstract	vehicles
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	addressed
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	cars
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	roads
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Each
I-abstract	car
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	specified
I-abstract	fixed
I-abstract	route
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	origin
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	destination
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	specify
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	sufficient
I-abstract	condition
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	road
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cars
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	guaranteed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	clear
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	finite
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	discrete
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	scheduling
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	defining
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	appropriate
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	road
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	(
I-abstract	LMCs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	solar
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	stars
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	companions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	projected
I-abstract	masses
I-abstract	(

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	commonly

I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	majority
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	\extrasolar
I-abstract	planets
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	argument
I-abstract	advanced
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	interpretation
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	extrasolar
I-abstract	planets
I-abstract	involves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	M
I-abstract	sin
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	here
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	parametric
I-abstract	statistical
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	objectively
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assertion
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	indeed
I-abstract	prove
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	strongly
I-abstract	suggest
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bulk
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	companions
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	extrasolar
I-abstract	planets
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	assertion
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	unfounded
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Indeed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	likely
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	LMCs
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	homogeneous
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	orbital
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	mass
I-abstract	parameters
I-abstract	essentially
I-abstract	indistinguishable
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	stellar
I-abstract	companions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	say
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	continuation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	stellar
I-abstract	mass
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	formation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	star
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	like
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	character
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	planetary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Indeed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	entirely
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	used
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	substitute
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	indirect
I-abstract	manipulation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	unfolded
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	investigate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	possibility
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	adopting
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	nondeterministic
I-abstract	developmental
I-abstract	mapping
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	evolution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	electronic
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	demands
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	phenotypes
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	functionally
I-abstract	stable
I-abstract	despite
I-abstract	limited
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	functional
I-abstract	robustness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	SBlock
I-abstract	circuits
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	amounts
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	developmental
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	noise
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	clocking
I-abstract	schemes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	exponential
I-abstract	decrease
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	robustness
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	increasing
I-abstract	noise
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	noise
I-abstract	injected
I-abstract	later
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	developmental
I-abstract	timescale
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	harmful
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	early
I-abstract	'
I-abstract	noise
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	effect
I-abstract	becomes
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	significant
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	noise
I-abstract	increases
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	realtive

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	effects
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	noise
I-abstract	seems
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	affected
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the

I-note	Acknowledgments
I-note	In
I-note	my
I-note	research
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	received
I-note	assistance
I-note	from
I-note	many
I-note	people
I-note	.
I-note	Calvin
I-note	Lin
I-note	,
I-note	an
I-note	assistant
I-note	professor
I-note	in
I-note	Computer
I-note	Sciences
I-note	,
I-note	is
I-note	my
I-note	supervising
I-note	professor
I-note	.
I-note	He
I-note	has
I-note	been
I-note	deeply
I-note	involved
I-note	in
I-note	guiding
I-note	my

I-note	and
I-note	is

I-note	-
I-note	author
I-note	on
I-note	all
I-note	of
I-note	my
I-note	recent
I-note	publications
I-note	.
I-note	Many
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	ideas
I-note	presented
I-note	in
I-note	this
I-note	dissertation
I-note	were
I-note	formed
I-note	in
I-note	discussions
I-note	with
I-note	Calvin
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	many
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	successful
I-note	ideas
I-note	I
I-note	came
I-note	up
I-note	with
I-note	on
I-note	my
I-note	own
I-note	were
I-note	ideas
I-note	I
I-note	almost
I-note	gave
I-note	up
I-note	on
I-note	when
I-note	Calvin
I-note	said
I-note	let's
I-note	take
I-note	another
I-note	look
I-note	at
I-note	this
I-note	.
I-note	Calvin
I-note	has
I-note	made
I-note	it
I-note	his
I-note	responsibility
I-note	to
I-note	make
I-note	sure
I-note	that
I-note	I
I-note	,
I-note	as
I-note	well
I-note	as
I-note	all
I-note	of
I-note	his
I-note	other
I-note	students
I-note	,
I-note	have
I-note	had
I-note	the
I-note	financial
I-note	support
I-note	we
I-note	need
I-note	to
I-note	accomplish
I-note	our
I-note	goals
I-note	;
I-note	he
I-note	is
I-note	a
I-note	staunch
I-note	advocate
I-note	for
I-note	each
I-note	of
I-note	us
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	although
I-note	he
I-note	leads
I-note	a
I-note	busy
I-note	life
I-note	,
I-note	it
I-note	seems
I-note	he
I-note	always
I-note	has
I-note	time
I-note	to
I-note	meet
I-note	with
I-note	us
I-note	and
I-note	discuss
I-note	whatever
I-note	is
I-note	on
I-note	our
I-note	minds
I-note	;
I-note	we
I-note	are
I-note	all
I-note	thankful
I-note	for
I-note	him

I-note	During
I-note	the
I-note	course
I-note	of
I-note	my
I-note	research
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	submitted
I-note	several
I-note	papers
I-note	to
I-note	peer
I-note	-
I-note	reviewed
I-note	conferences
I-note	.
I-note	The

I-note	have
I-note	provided
I-note	valuable
I-note	insights
I-note	,
I-note	pointers
I-note	to
I-note	literature
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	criticisms
I-note	that
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	used
I-note	to
I-note	make
I-note	my
I-note	research
I-note	stronger
I-note	.
I-note	Last
I-note	,
I-note	but
I-note	not
I-note	least
I-note	,
I-note	my
I-note	wife
I-note	,
I-note	Stella
I-note	L. 
I-note	Jimenez
I-note	,
I-note	has
I-note	endured
I-note	the
I-note	several
I-note	years
I-note	of
I-note	my
I-note	graduate
I-note	career
I-note	with
I-note	more
I-note	cheer
I-note	than
I-note	I
I-note	could
I-note	have
I-note	expected
I-note	.
I-note	She
I-note	is
I-note	my
I-note	best
I-note	friend
I-note	and
I-note	the
I-note	source
I-note	of
I-note	my
I-note	strength
I-note	.
I-note	She
I-note	has
I-note	supported
I-note	our
I-note	household
I-note	financially
I-note	through
I-note	my
I-note	years
I-note	of
I-note	voluntarily
I-note	reduced
I-note	earnings
I-note	.
I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Accurate
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	essential
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	modern
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	deeply
I-abstract	pipelined
I-abstract	microprocessors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Because
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	critical
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	fetching
I-abstract	instructions
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	deliver
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	feature
I-abstract	sizes
I-abstract	shrink
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	increase
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	access
I-abstract	delay
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	decrease
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	size
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	accessed
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	single
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tradeoff
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	latency
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Deeper
I-abstract	pipelines
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	allowing
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	aggressive
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	lost
I-abstract	due
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	increased
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	misprediction
I-abstract	penalties
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Ironically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	shorter
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	periods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	might
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	scaled
I-abstract	back
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	faster
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	decreases
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	advantage
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	breaking
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	tradeoff
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	latency
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	fall
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	broad
I-abstract	categories
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	purely
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	implementations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	off
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	load
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	organizations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	extend
I-abstract	traditional
I-abstract	predictors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	highly
I-abstract	accurate
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	hierarchical
I-abstract	organization
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	multi
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	off
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	loads
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	profiling
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	communicates
I-abstract	profiled
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	microprocessor
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	extensions
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	instruction
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	Boolean
I-abstract	formula
I-abstract	predictor
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	fast
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	cycle
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	smallest
I-abstract	technologies
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	aggressive
I-abstract	projected
I-abstract	clock
I-abstract	rates
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	another
I-abstract	cooperative
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	branch
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	aliasing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	moves
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	off
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	critical
I-abstract	path
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	prediction
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	compiler
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	increases
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	destructive
I-abstract	aliasing
I-abstract	during
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	critical

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	whose

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	let
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	with

I-abstract	3
I-abstract	log
I-abstract	(

I-abstract	)
I-abstract	2
I-abstract	L
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Furthermore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	establish
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	near
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	optimality
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dyadic
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	comparisons
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	obtained
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	constructed
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	dyadic
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	best
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	line
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	recently

I-abstract	differ
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	their

I-abstract	with
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	line
I-abstract	optimal
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	worst
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	no
I-abstract	worse
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	earlier
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dyadic
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	appears
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	first

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	have
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	with

I-abstract	events
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Often
I-abstract	these

I-abstract	Our

I-abstract	decomposes

I-abstract	It
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	enforces

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	works
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Humans
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	monkeys
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	direct
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	eyes
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	spatial
I-abstract	location
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	briefly
I-abstract	flashed
I-abstract	targets
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	saccade
I-abstract	intervenes
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	stimulus
I-abstract	flash
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	saccade
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	acquire
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	location
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	had
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	oculomotor
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	performs
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	resorting
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	supraretinal
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	review
I-abstract	neurophysiological
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	clinical
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	suggesting
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	strategy
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	require
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	supraretinal
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	targets
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	implement
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	keep
I-abstract	track
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	location
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	saccade
I-abstract	targets
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	eye
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	centered
I-abstract	coordinates
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	recent
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	argue
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	fact
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	keep
I-abstract	track
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	saccade
I-abstract	targets
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	location

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	(1)
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	adequate
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	debug
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	probe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	removed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(2)
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	assess
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	gain
I-abstract	confidence
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	reliable
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	names
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	most
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	degree
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	debug
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	tend
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	ignore
I-abstract	random
I-abstract	selection
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	profile
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	while
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	selection
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	important
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Debug
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	thought
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	without
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	proof
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	good
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	uncovering
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	repaired
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	done
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technically
I-abstract	defensible
I-abstract	assessment
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	On
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	hand
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	accurate
I-abstract	assessment
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	useful
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	achieving
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	examines
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relationship
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	goals
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	probabilistic
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	define
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	try
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	theoretically
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	question
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	attain
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	Is
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	better
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	probing
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	debug
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	assess
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	directly
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	uncovering
I-abstract	defects
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	accident
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	speak
I-abstract	?
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	no
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	answer
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	course
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Testing
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	failures
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	detected
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	software
I-abstract	changed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	eliminate
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	\better"
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	delivers
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	test
I-abstract	failures
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	eliminated
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	comparison
I-abstract	extends
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	measure
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	detecting
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	failure
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Revealing
I-abstract	special
I-abstract	cases
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	exhibited
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	kind
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	testing
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	superior
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Preliminary
I-abstract	analysis
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	distribution
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	delivered
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	indicates
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	unusual
I-abstract	statistical
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	For
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	might
I-abstract	appear
I-abstract	after

I-abstract	Such

I-abstract	complicate

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	description
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	exploit
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	highly

I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	enables
I-abstract	implementations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	combine
I-abstract	high

I-abstract	low
I-abstract	power
I-abstract	consumption
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reduced
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	leads
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is

I-abstract	both
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	using

I-abstract	in

I-abstract	The
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	this

I-abstract	make

I-abstract	efficiency
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	overall
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	explores
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	and
I-abstract	trade
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	offs
I-abstract	between

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	rendering
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	virtual
I-abstract	humans
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Though
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	deal
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	virtual
I-abstract	humans
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	concept
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	articulated
I-abstract	character
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	termed
I-abstract	animated
I-abstract	impostors
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	extends
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	notion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	impostors
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	take
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	character's
I-abstract	appearance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	impostors
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	embedded
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	simulations
I-abstract	/

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	unexpected
I-abstract	convergence
I-abstract	behaviour
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	genetic
I-abstract	Programming
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	GP
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Firstly
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relationship
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	attainable
I-abstract	classification
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Secondly
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	attempt
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	understand
I-abstract	why
I-abstract	GP
I-abstract	classifiers
I-abstract	sometimes
I-abstract	fail
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reach
I-abstract	satisfactory
I-abstract	levels
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	accuracy
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	regardless
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	investigation
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	artificially
I-abstract	generated
I-abstract	dataset
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	certain
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	known
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	advance
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	exploration
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Results
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	artificial
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	increasing
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	effort
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	larger
I-abstract	population
I-abstract	sizes
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	generations
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	by
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	iteration
I-abstract	around
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	subdivision

I-abstract	we
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	conditions
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	implicated
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	several

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	I

I-abstract	a

I-abstract	taken
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	autopilot
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	find
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	domains
I-abstract	outside
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	traditionally
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	phenomena
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	interest
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	modeled
I-abstract	effectively

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	Objects
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	just
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	exist
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	memories
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	once
I-abstract	existed
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	since
I-abstract	disappeared
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	projections
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	expected
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	exist
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	future
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	because
I-abstract	something
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	appears
I-abstract	straightforward
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	becomes
I-abstract	far
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	complicated
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	consider
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	change
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	addressed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	elaborating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	clients
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	concerned
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	temporal
I-abstract	aspects
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	TV
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	minimization
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	restoration
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	remove
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	singularity
I-abstract	caused
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	differentiability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quantity
I-abstract	jruj
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	definition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	TV
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	norm
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	apply
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	linearization
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	Newton's
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	accomplished
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	introducing
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	additional
I-abstract	variable
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	flux
I-abstract	quantity
I-abstract	appearing
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	gradient
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	function
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	interpreted
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	normal
I-abstract	vector
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	sets
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	u
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	viewed
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	primal
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	dual
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	Conn
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Overton
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	9
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	Andersen
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	3
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	minimization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	sum
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Euclidean
I-abstract	norms
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	possessing
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	quadratic
I-abstract	convergence
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	experimental
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	seems
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	globally
I-abstract	convergent
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	also
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	usability
I-abstract	aspects
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	modeling
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	helps
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	concerns
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	early
I-abstract	stages
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	take
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	manipulation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	control
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	continuous
I-abstract	processes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	via
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	respect
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	refine
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	composite
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	entities
I-abstract	comprising
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	taken
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	account
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	message
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	oriented
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	should
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	formulated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	reference
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	understanding
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	relationships
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	intelligent
I-abstract	decision
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	making
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	CLARAty
I-abstract	robotic
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	autonomy
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	CLARAty
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	layered
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	top
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	contains
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	autonomously
I-abstract	creating
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	plan
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	commands
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	bottom
I-abstract	Functional
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	standard
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	interface
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	focuses
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	organization
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	capabilities
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	utilizing
I-abstract	AI
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	executive
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	provide
I-abstract	onboard
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	command
I-abstract	generation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	planning
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	planetary
I-abstract	rovers
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	Decision
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	flexible
I-abstract	interface
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Functional
I-abstract	Layer
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	tailored
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	preferences
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	domain
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	tested
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	JPL
I-abstract	rovers
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Given
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	\No
I-abstract	Z-C
I-abstract	ycle
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	NZC
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	states
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	dependency
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	itself
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	words
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	there
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	exists
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	causal
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	messages
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	starts
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	terminates
I-abstract	before
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	From
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	operational
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	view
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	corresponds
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fact
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	belongs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	least
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	consistent
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	So
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	could
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	restarting
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	after
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	occurrence
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	failure
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	derive
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	minimal
I-abstract	characterization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	NZC
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	open
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	defines
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	minimal
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	Z
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	cycles
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	namely
I-abstract	Core
I-abstract	Z-C
I-abstract	ycles
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	CZCs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	absent
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	satisfies
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	NZC
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Then
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	induced
I-abstract	checkpointing
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	prevents
I-abstract	CZCs
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	thefly
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	protocol
I-abstract	actually
I-abstract	removes
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	checkpoint
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	whose
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	common
I-abstract	causal
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	CZC
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	taxonomy
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	induced
I-abstract	checkpointing
I-abstract	protocols
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	ensure
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	NZC
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	execution
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	key

I-abstract	in
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	iterative

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	establish
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	properties
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modified
I-abstract	Gram
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Schmidt
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	why
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	modified
I-abstract	Gram
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	Schmidt
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	conditioned
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	vectors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	holds
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assumption
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	initial
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	\too
I-abstract	ill

I-abstract	conditioned
I-abstract	"
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	quantified
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	As
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	consequence
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	iterations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	performed
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	produces
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	matrix
I-abstract	whose
I-abstract	columns
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	orthogonal
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	machine
I-abstract	precision
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	numerical
I-abstract	experiment
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sharpness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	result
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	we
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	representing
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	constraint
I-abstract	networks
I-abstract	arising
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	procedures
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	represent
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	effectively
I-abstract	reason
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	general
I-abstract	constraints
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	handle
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	changes
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	deletion
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	values
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	reason
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	valued
I-abstract	variables
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	utilize
I-abstract	special
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	purpose
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	methods
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	arithmetic
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	procedures
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	resulting
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	sound
I-abstract	theoretical
I-abstract	foundation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	guarantees
I-abstract	termination
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Fixturing
I-abstract	encompasses
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	such

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	Generally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	fixture
I-abstract	vise
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	handle

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	runs
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	O
I-abstract	(

I-abstract	not
I-abstract	sufficient
I-abstract	precondition
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	force

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	provides
