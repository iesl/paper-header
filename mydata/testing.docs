I-abstract	One
I-abstract	difficulty
I-abstract	with

I-abstract	their

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	address
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	external
I-abstract	force
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	external
I-abstract	force
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	convex
I-abstract	combination
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	curvature
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	boundary
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	force
I-abstract	simultaneously
I-abstract	pulls
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	snake
I-abstract	toward
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	solving
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	perceptual
I-abstract	grouping
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	vision
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	focusing
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	local
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	consistencies
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	aims
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	extracting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	impression
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	treat
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	segmentation
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	partitioning
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	global
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	normalized
I-abstract	cut
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	segmenting
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	graph
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	normalized
I-abstract	cut
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	measures
I-abstract	both
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	dissimilarity
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	groups
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	similarity
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	groups
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	generalized
I-abstract	eigenvalue
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	optimize
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	criterion
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	applied
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	segmenting
I-abstract	static
I-abstract	images
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	found
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	very

I-abstract	the
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	levels
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	users
I-abstract	feel
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	in

I-abstract	when

I-abstract	Despite

I-abstract	we

I-abstract	find
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	We

I-note	of

I-note	.
I-note	We

I-note	designing
I-note	,
I-note	building
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	using

I-note	.
I-note	The

I-note	high

I-note	The
I-note	long
I-note	-
I-note	term
I-note	goal
I-note	of
I-note	WRL
I-note	is
I-note	to
I-note	aid

I-note	.
I-note	The

I-note	various
I-note	aspects
I-note	of

I-note	We
I-note	believe
I-note	that
I-note	significant
I-note	advances
I-note	in
I-note	computer

I-note	do
I-note	not
I-note	come

I-note	System
I-note	design

I-note	A
I-note	major
I-note	advance
I-note	in
I-note	overall
I-note	system
I-note	performance
I-note	will
I-note	require
I-note	reexamination
I-note	of
I-note	all
I-note	aspects
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	system
I-note	.
I-note	We
I-note	do

I-note	in
I-note	the
I-note	design
I-note	,
I-note	fabrication
I-note	and
I-note	packaging
I-note	of

I-note	and

I-note	issues
I-note	in

I-note	software
I-note	design
I-note	;
I-note	and
I-note	the
I-note	exploration
I-note	of
I-note	new
I-note	applications
I-note	areas
I-note	that
I-note	are
I-note	opening
I-note	up
I-note	with
I-note	the
I-note	advent
I-note	of
I-note	higher

I-note	systems
I-note	.
I-note	Researchers

I-note	the
I-note	various
I-note	levels
I-note	of

I-note	.
I-note	This

I-abstract	We

I-note	SRC
I-note	is
I-note	to
I-note	advance
I-note	both
I-note	the
I-note	state
I-note	of

I-note	and
I-note	the
I-note	state
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	art
I-note	in
I-note	computer
I-note	systems
I-note	.
I-note	From
I-note	our
I-note	establishment
I-note	in
I-note	1984
I-note	,
I-note	we
I-note	have
I-note	performed
I-note	basic
I-note	and
I-note	applied
I-note	research
I-note	to
I-note	support
I-note	Digital's
I-note	business
I-note	objectives
I-note	.
I-note	Our
I-note	current
I-note	work
I-note	includes
I-note	exploring
I-note	distributed
I-note	personal
I-note	computing
I-note	on
I-note	multiple
I-note	platforms
I-note	,
I-note	networking

I-note	modelling
I-note	and
I-note	management
I-note	techniques
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	selected
I-note	applications
I-note	.
I-note	Our
I-note	strategy
I-note	is
I-note	to
I-note	test
I-note	the
I-note	technical
I-note	and
I-note	practical
I-note	value
I-note	of
I-note	our
I-note	ideas
I-note	by
I-note	building
I-note	hardware
I-note	and
I-note	software
I-note	prototypes
I-note	and
I-note	using
I-note	them
I-note	as
I-note	daily
I-note	tools
I-note	.
I-note	Interesting
I-note	systems
I-note	are
I-note	too
I-note	complex
I-note	to
I-note	be
I-note	evaluated
I-note	solely

I-note	;

I-note	allows
I-note	us
I-note	to
I-note	investigate
I-note	their
I-note	properties
I-note	in
I-note	depth
I-note	.
I-note	This
I-note	experience
I-note	is
I-note	useful
I-note	in
I-note	the
I-note	short
I-note	term
I-note	in
I-note	refining
I-note	our
I-note	designs
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	invaluable
I-note	in
I-note	the
I-note	long
I-note	term
I-note	in
I-note	advancing
I-note	our
I-note	knowledge
I-note	.
I-note	Most
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	major
I-note	advances
I-note	in
I-note	information
I-note	systems
I-note	have
I-note	come
I-note	through
I-note	this
I-note	strategy
I-note	,
I-note	including
I-note	personal
I-note	computing
I-note	,
I-note	distributed
I-note	systems
I-note	,
I-note	and
I-note	the
I-note	Internet
I-note	.
I-note	We
I-note	also
I-note	perform
I-note	complementary
I-note	work
I-note	of
I-note	a
I-note	more
I-note	mathematical
I-note	flavor
I-note	.
I-note	Some
I-note	of
I-note	it
I-note	is

I-note	fields
I-note	of
I-note	theoretical

I-note	,

I-abstract	A
I-abstract	frequent
I-abstract	dilemma
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	programming
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	choice
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	rich
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	notations
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	dilemma
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	proposing
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	grammars
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	syntax
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	definition
I-abstract	formalism
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	incremental
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	extensions
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	restrictions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	translation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	programs
I-abstract	written
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	rich
I-abstract	object
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	language
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	defined
I-abstract	via
I-abstract	syntax
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	directed
I-abstract	patterns
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	macro
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	expansion
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	program
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	rewriting
I-abstract	tools
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	grammarsrespect
I-abstract	scoping
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Therefore
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	introduce
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	constructs
I-abstract	while
I-abstract	avoiding
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	unwanted
I-abstract	name
I-abstract	clashes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	develop
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	grammars
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	extending
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lambda
I-abstract	calculus
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	let
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	bindings
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	conditionals
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	constructs
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	database
I-abstract	programming
I-abstract	languages
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	SQL
I-abstract	query
I-abstract	expressions
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	description
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	parsing
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	transformation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	substitution
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	sketch
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	rules
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	exploited
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	extensible
I-abstract	parser
I-abstract	package
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	automatically
I-abstract	identifying
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	aligned
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	structures
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	subset
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	atoms
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	small
I-abstract	amount
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	e
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	apply
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	globin
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	proteins
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	purely
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	procedure
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	show
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	globin
I-abstract	fold
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	divided
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	greater
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	consists
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	residues
I-abstract	near
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	heme
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	F
I-abstract	helix
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	parts
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	G
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	H
I-abstract	helices
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	part
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	lesser
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	forms
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	similar
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	repressor
I-abstract	protein
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	B
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	E
I-abstract	helices
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	remainder
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	G
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	H
I-abstract	helices
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Such
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	division
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	consistent
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	biochemical
I-abstract	findings
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	addition
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	find
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	partitions
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	may
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	biological
I-abstract	significance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	globin
I-abstract	family
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	reference
I-abstract	point
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	variation
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	core
I-abstract	definition
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	sequence
I-abstract	conservation
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	necessarily
I-abstract	agree
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	structural
I-abstract	similarity
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	and

I-abstract	MDD's
I-abstract	are

I-abstract	One

I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Comparison

I-abstract	Our

I-abstract	contains
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	-

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	For
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	utility
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These

I-abstract	are

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	with
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	conclude
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	decoupling
I-abstract	hol
I-abstract	from

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	retain
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	two

I-abstract	Unlike

I-abstract	L
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	this
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	shown
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	1985
I-abstract	by

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This

I-abstract	announces
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we

I-abstract	The

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Perhaps

I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	an

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	content
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	knowledge

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	large

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	derived
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	Book
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	covers

I-abstract	broad
I-abstract	range
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	world's
I-abstract	nations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	World
I-abstract	Fact
I-abstract	Book
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	highly
I-abstract	structured
I-abstract	document
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	complex
I-abstract	underlying
I-abstract	ontology
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	parse
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	document
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	carry
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	knowledge

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	irregularities
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	text
I-abstract	written
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	humans
I-abstract	and

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	construct
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	World

I-abstract	Book

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	parsing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	source
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	refining
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	implicit

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	constructing
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	ontology
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reusing
I-abstract	exist
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	ontologies
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	discuss
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	representational
I-abstract	issues
I-abstract	addressed

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	We

I-abstract	Revocation
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	7
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	perform
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	rekeying
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	stateless
I-abstract	manner
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	statelessness
I-abstract	comes
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	storage
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	messaging
I-abstract	overhead
I-abstract	when
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	[3]
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	address
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Briefly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	maintaining
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	static
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	accommodate
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	only
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	dynamically
I-abstract	assign
I-abstract	current
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	positions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	fixed
I-abstract	pre
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	assignment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	tree
I-abstract	requires
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	storage
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	assignment
I-abstract	achieves
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	smaller
I-abstract	rekeying
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	enhancements
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	further
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	evaluation
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	improves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	reducing
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	half
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	rekey
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	cost
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	currently
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Also
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	compared
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	[
I-abstract	7
I-abstract	]
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	dynamic
I-abstract	SDR
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	know
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	maximum
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	potential
I-abstract	group
I-abstract	members
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	advance
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	difficult
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	ways
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	addressing
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	areas
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	neocortex
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	hippocampus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	prefrontal
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	None
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	approaches
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	popular
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	temporal
I-abstract	synchrony
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	first
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	conjunctive
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	bind
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	ensuring
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	units
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	activated
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	combinations
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	input
I-abstract	features
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Specifically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	think
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	constructs
I-abstract	low
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	conjunctions
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	coarse
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	coded
I-abstract	distributed
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	avoid
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	combinatorial
I-abstract	explosion
I-abstract	usually
I-abstract	associated
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	conjunctive
I-abstract	solutions
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	learns
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	representations
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	challenging
I-abstract	relational
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	furthermore
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	capable
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	considerable
I-abstract	generalization
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	inputs
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Next
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	review
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	hippocampus
I-abstract	performs
I-abstract	conjunctive
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	long
I-abstract	term
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	higher
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	conjunctions
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	much
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	specific
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	events
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	cortex
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Finally
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	model
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	form
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	involves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	phonological
I-abstract	loop
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	maintaining
I-abstract	arbitrary
I-abstract	sequences
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	phonemes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	active
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	phonological
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	bind
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	continuously
I-abstract	repeating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	bound
I-abstract	information
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	e

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	green
I-abstract	X's
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	total
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	suggests
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	instead
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	generic
I-abstract	solution
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	binding
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	number
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	specialized
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	build
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	strengths
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	neural
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	different
I-abstract	brain
I-abstract	areas

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	typed
I-abstract	setting
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	contain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	modal
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	constructor
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	classifies

I-abstract	code
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	code
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	generally
I-abstract	come
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	flavors
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	closed
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	open
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Closed
I-abstract	code

I-abstract	better

I-abstract	Recent
I-abstract	work

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	achieve
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	adding
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	from
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	on

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	provides

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	shows
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	distribute
I-abstract	GPS
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	with

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Our
I-abstract	SynUTC
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	1
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	upon
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	level
I-abstract	hardware
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	packets
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	leave
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	arrive
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	node
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	comes
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	flavours
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	method
I-abstract	exploited

I-abstract	as
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controller
I-abstract	accesses
I-abstract	them
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	used
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	virtually
I-abstract	any
I-abstract	type
I-abstract	of

I-abstract	down
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Still
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	memory
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	requires
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	controllers
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	store
I-abstract	entire

I-abstract	on
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	chip
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	available
I-abstract	configuration
I-abstract	parameters
I-abstract	must
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	carefully
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to

I-abstract	with
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	various

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	escape
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	those
I-abstract	limitations
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	recently
I-abstract	developed
I-abstract	a

I-abstract	MII
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	timestamping
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	that

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	machine
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	attractive
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	since
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	enables
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	adapt
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	unforeseen
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	bottlenecks
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	current
I-abstract	machine
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	enormous
I-abstract	sample
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	appears
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	prohibit
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	usage
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	all
I-abstract	but
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	simplest
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	robotic
I-abstract	domains
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	machine
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	practical
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	domains
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	powerful
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	needed
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	generalize
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	accurately
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	training
I-abstract	data
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	feasibility
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	gradually
I-abstract	improve
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lifetime
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	When
I-abstract	faced
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	thing
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	learn
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	acquired
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	previous
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	improves
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	ability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	generalize
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	hence
I-abstract	reduces
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	sample
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	applying
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	particular
I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	perception
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	originally
I-abstract	proposed
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	Suddarth
I-abstract	[15]
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	considered
I-abstract	involve
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	recognition
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	persons
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	objects
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	locations
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	having
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	learned
I-abstract	related
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	learn
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	significantly
I-abstract	fewer
I-abstract	training
I-abstract	examples
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	was
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	scratch
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	these
I-abstract	results
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	argue
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	self
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	adjusting
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	strategies
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	superior
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	conventional
I-abstract	learning
I-abstract	algorithms
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	robotic
I-abstract	domains
I-abstract	.

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	dissertation
I-abstract	addresses
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	bottleneck
I-abstract	problem
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	file
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	updated
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	weakly
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	connected
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	proposes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	more
I-abstract	efficient
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	called
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	update
I-abstract	propagation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	or
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	ships
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	updated
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	rather
I-abstract	than
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	themselves
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	across
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	weak
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	contrast
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	mechanisms
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	ship
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	sent
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	surrogate
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	strongly
I-abstract	connected
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	surrogate
I-abstract	replays
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	user
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	generates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	checks
I-abstract	whether
I-abstract	they
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	identical
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	originals
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	so
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	send
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	behalf
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	If
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	report
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	failure
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	client
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	will
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	fall
I-abstract	back
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	value
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	propagate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	files
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Note
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	new
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	neither
I-abstract	compromises
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	nor
I-abstract	hampers
I-abstract	server
I-abstract	scalability
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	There
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	types
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shippings
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	transparent
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	aware
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Their
I-abstract	feasibilities
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	benefits
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	demonstrated
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	evaluation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	realistic
I-abstract	prototypes
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	These
I-abstract	prototypes
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	extended
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	systems
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Coda
I-abstract	File
I-abstract	System
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	Bourne
I-abstract	Again
I-abstract	Shell
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	bash
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	GIMP
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	image
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	bash
I-abstract	shell
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	shell
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	works
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	Coda
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	transparent
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	GIMP
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	chosen
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	works
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	Coda
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	aware
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	former
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	many
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	noninteractive
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	modified
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	being
I-abstract	involved
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	ii
I-abstract	iii
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	;
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	latter
I-abstract	case
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	existing
I-abstract	interactive
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	do
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	some
I-abstract	moderate
I-abstract	modifications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	prototypes
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	evaluated
I-abstract	using
I-abstract	controlled
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	experiments
I-abstract	have
I-abstract	demonstrated
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	huge
I-abstract	performance
I-abstract	improvements
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	ranged
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	40
I-abstract	percents
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	nearly
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	orders
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	magnitude
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	terms
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	reduced
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	traffic
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	elapsed
I-abstract	time
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Besides
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	work
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	made
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	main
I-abstract	contributions
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	techniques
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	fixing
I-abstract	non
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	repeating
I-abstract	side
I-abstract	effects
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	novel
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	forward
I-abstract	error
I-abstract	correction
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	temporary
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	file
I-abstract	renaming
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	re
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	enabling
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	use
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	cancellation
I-abstract	optimization
I-abstract	with
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	study
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	alternatives
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	support
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	aware
I-abstract	operation
I-abstract	shipping
I-abstract	.

I-note	Acknowledgments
I-note	Throughout
I-note	these
I-note	four
I-note	years
I-note	,
I-note	there
I-note	were
I-note	hurdles
I-note	and
I-note	difficulties
I-note	,
I-note	but
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	been
I-note	lucky
I-note	that
I-note	helping
I-note	hands
I-note	were
I-note	always
I-note	around
I-note	.
I-note	First
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	must
I-note	thank
I-note	my
I-note	supervisor
I-note	,
I-note	Professor
I-note	Kwong
I-note	-
I-note	Sak
I-note	Leung
I-note	.
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	learned
I-note	a
I-note	lot
I-note	from
I-note	him
I-note	.
I-note	Technical
I-note	matters
I-note	aside
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	learned
I-note	from
I-note	him
I-note	much
I-note	wisdom
I-note	about
I-note	life
I-note	.
I-note	Also
I-note	,
I-note	even
I-note	though
I-note	he
I-note	has
I-note	a
I-note	very
I-note	busy
I-note	schedule
I-note	,
I-note	he
I-note	is
I-note	always
I-note	available
I-note	for
I-note	help
I-note	and
I-note	advice
I-note	.
I-note	Most
I-note	importantly
I-note	,
I-note	he
I-note	has
I-note	given
I-note	me
I-note	a
I-note	free
I-note	hand
I-note	to
I-note	pursue
I-note	what
I-note	really
I-note	interests
I-note	me
I-note	.
I-note	Without
I-note	his
I-note	open
I-note	-
I-note	mindedness
I-note	,
I-note	this
I-note	thesis
I-note	could
I-note	not
I-note	have
I-note	been
I-note	possible
I-note	.
I-note	I
I-note	am
I-note	also
I-note	in
I-note	deep
I-note	gratitude
I-note	to
I-note	Professor
I-note	M. 
I-note	Satyanarayanan
I-note	(
I-note	or
I-note	Satya
I-note	,
I-note	as
I-note	we
I-note	usually
I-note	affectionately
I-note	call
I-note	him
I-note	)
I-note	in
I-note	Carnegie
I-note	Mellon
I-note	University
I-note	.
I-note	He
I-note	has
I-note	been
I-note	a
I-note	constant
I-note	source
I-note	of
I-note	advice
I-note	and
I-note	support
I-note	for
I-note	me
I-note	,
I-note	from
I-note	thesis
I-note	matters
I-note	to
I-note	career
I-note	planning
I-note	.
I-note	He
I-note	is
I-note	really
I-note	a
I-note	great
I-note	mentor
I-note	and
I-note	a
I-note	true
I-note	friend
I-note	of
I-note	mine
I-note	.
I-note	He
I-note	always
I-note	gives
I-note	me
I-note	the
I-note	most
I-note	appropriate
I-note	advice
I-note	-
I-note	even
I-note	if
I-note	it
I-note	might
I-note	not
I-note	be
I-note	to
I-note	his
I-note	ultimate
I-note	benefit
I-note	.
I-note	Furthermore
I-note	,
I-note	he
I-note	has
I-note	invited
I-note	me
I-note	to
I-note	visit
I-note	Coda
I-note	group
I-note	in
I-note	CMU
I-note	for
I-note	one
I-note	year
I-note	,
I-note	which
I-note	proved
I-note	to
I-note	be
I-note	a
I-note	turning
I-note	point
I-note	of
I-note	my
I-note	research
I-note	career
I-note	.
I-note	Also
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	am
I-note	honored
I-note	that
I-note	Satya
I-note	agrees
I-note	to
I-note	serve
I-note	in
I-note	my
I-note	thesis
I-note	committee
I-note	.
I-note	I
I-note	must
I-note	express
I-note	my
I-note	appreciation
I-note	to
I-note	Professor
I-note	John
I-note	C.S. 
I-note	Lui
I-note	and
I-note	Professor
I-note	ManHon
I-note	Wong
I-note	.
I-note	They
I-note	both
I-note	serve
I-note	in
I-note	my
I-note	thesis
I-note	committee
I-note	and
I-note	have
I-note	been
I-note	teachers
I-note	and
I-note	friends
I-note	of
I-note	mine
I-note	for
I-note	many
I-note	years
I-note	.
I-note	In
I-note	CMU
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	had
I-note	the
I-note	chance
I-note	to
I-note	work
I-note	with
I-note	the
I-note	Coda
I-note	and
I-note	Odyssey
I-note	groups
I-note	.
I-note	I
I-note	believe
I-note	they
I-note	are
I-note	among
I-note	the
I-note	best
I-note	computer
I-note	-
I-note	science
I-note	research
I-note	groups
I-note	in
I-note	the
I-note	world
I-note	.
I-note	I
I-note	am
I-note	grateful
I-note	for
I-note	the
I-note	help
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	many
I-note	current
I-note	and
I-note	past
I-note	members
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	two
I-note	groups
I-note	:

I-note	I
I-note	must
I-note	especially
I-note	mention
I-note	David
I-note	Eckhardt
I-note	.
I-note	He
I-note	is
I-note	one
I-note	of
I-note	the
I-note	greatest
I-note	guys
I-note	that
I-note	I
I-note	have
I-note	met

I-note	Coda
I-note	group
I-note	by
I-note	the

I-note	their

I-note	and
I-note	RVM
I-note	definitely
I-note	have
I-note	enlightened

I-note	Wah
I-note	,
I-note	for
I-note	they
I-note	have
I-note	given
I-note	me
I-note	a
I-note	family
I-note	filled
I-note	with
I-note	love
I-note	and
I-note	care
I-note	.
I-note	Finally
I-note	,
I-note	my
I-note	wife
I-note	,
I-note	Wing
I-note	,
I-note	deserves
I-note	greater
I-note	thanks
I-note	than
I-note	I
I-note	can
I-note	possibly
I-note	give
I-note	.
I-note	She
I-note	encouraged
I-note	me
I-note	to
I-note	pursue
I-note	my
I-note	PhD
I-note	study
I-note	,
I-note	at
I-note	a
I-note	time
I-note	when
I-note	I
I-note	was
I-note	still
I-note	in
I-note	doubt
I-note	.
I-note	I
I-note	often
I-note	think
I-note	that
I-note	she
I-note	knows
I-note	me
I-note	better
I-note	than
I-note	I
I-note	myself
I-note	.
I-note	Her
I-note	supports
I-note	for
I-note	me
I-note	,
I-note	in
I-note	various
I-note	forms
I-note	,
I-note	over
I-note	the
I-note	years
I-note	have
I-note	been
I-note	enormous
I-note	.
I-note	For
I-note	example
I-note	,
I-note	in
I-note	1996
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	decided
I-note	to
I-note	visit
I-note	CMU
I-note	for
I-note	one
I-note	year
I-note	and
I-note	would
I-note	thus
I-note	be
I-note	separated
I-note	from
I-note	her
I-note	.
I-note	She
I-note	did
I-note	not
I-note	complain
I-note	;
I-note	instead
I-note	,
I-note	she
I-note	supported
I-note	me
I-note	enthusiastically
I-note	.
I-note	We
I-note	mitigated
I-note	the
I-note	hardship
I-note	of
I-note	separation
I-note	by
I-note	staying
I-note	together
I-note	in
I-note	all
I-note	major
I-note	vacations
I-note	.
I-note	For
I-note	that
I-note	she
I-note	flew
I-note	three
I-note	times
I-note	from
I-note	Hong
I-note	Kong
I-note	to
I-note	Pittsburgh
I-note	and
I-note	earned
I-note	48
I-note	,
I-note	000
I-note	miles
I-note	of
I-note	mileage
I-note	in
I-note	one
I-note	year
I-note	!
I-note	Without
I-note	her
I-note	love
I-note	and
I-note	sacrifice
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	could
I-note	never
I-note	have
I-note	come
I-note	this
I-note	far
I-note	.
I-note	Wing
I-note	,
I-note	I
I-note	love
I-note	you
I-note	.

I-abstract	ABSTRACT
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	throughput
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	ad
I-abstract	hoc
I-abstract	networks
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	MANETs
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	analyzed
I-abstract	previously
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	possible
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	traffic
I-abstract	pattern
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	where
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	sessions
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	between
I-abstract	pairs
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	nodes
I-abstract	arbitrarily
I-abstract	situated
I-abstract	throughout
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	lengthy
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	hop
I-abstract	paths
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	such
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	sessions
I-abstract	constrict
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	throughput
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	spatial
I-abstract	reuse
I-abstract	still
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	aggregate
I-abstract	network
I-abstract	throughput
I-abstract	t
I-abstract	o
I-abstract	scale
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	rate
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	i
I-abstract	s
I-abstract	proportional
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	square
I-abstract	root
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	node
I-abstract	count
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	On
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	hand

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	presents
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	implementation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	multi
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	threaded
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	engine
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	enable
I-abstract	scalable

I-abstract	adaptive
I-abstract	mesh
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	refinement
I-abstract	(
I-abstract	AMR
I-abstract	)
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	primary
I-abstract	objective
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	manage
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	heterogeneity
I-abstract	inherent
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	class
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	exploit
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	multiple
I-abstract	granularities
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	levels
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	parallelism
I-abstract	offered
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	engine
I-abstract	uses
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	MPI
I-abstract	communication
I-abstract	library
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	implements
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	for
I-abstract	registering
I-abstract	message
I-abstract	handlers
I-abstract	at
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	application
I-abstract	level

I-abstract	These
I-abstract	handlers
I-abstract	enable
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	computational
I-abstract	thread
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	define
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	messages
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	processed
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Communications

I-abstract	can
I-abstract	now

I-abstract	all

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The

I-abstract	An

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	to
I-abstract	deploy
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	type

I-abstract	we
I-abstract	propose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	simple
I-abstract	mechanism
I-abstract	,

I-abstract	With

I-abstract	can

I-abstract	to

I-abstract	description
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	for

I-abstract	with
I-abstract	very
I-abstract	large
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	spaces
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	prior
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	algorithm
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	refinement
I-abstract	-

I-abstract	task
I-abstract	needs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	decomposed
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	subtasks
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	manageable
I-abstract	complexity
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	natural
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	decompose
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	task
I-abstract	following
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	structure
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	However
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	individual
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	often
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	satisfy
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	requirements
I-abstract	un
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	less
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	put
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	right
I-abstract	context
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	constrains
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	inputs
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Thus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	order
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	verify
I-abstract	each
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	individually
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	need
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	make
I-abstract	assumptions
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	inputs
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	are
I-abstract	provided
I-abstract	by
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	other
I-abstract	components
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	design
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	circular
I-abstract	:
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	A
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	verified
I-abstract	under
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assumption
I-abstract	that
I-abstract	context
I-abstract	B
I-abstract	behaves
I-abstract	correctly
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	symmetrically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	B
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	verified
I-abstract	assuming
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	correctness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	A.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	guarantee
I-abstract	paradigm
I-abstract	provides
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	systematic
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	methodology
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	ensuring
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	soundness
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	circular
I-abstract	style
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	postulating
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	discharging
I-abstract	assumptions
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	component
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	reasoning
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	give
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	tutorial
I-abstract	introduction
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	assume
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	guarantee
I-abstract	paradigm
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	decomposing
I-abstract	refinement
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	checking
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	To
I-abstract	illustrate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	step
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	detail
I-abstract	through
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	verification
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	processor
I-abstract	pipeline
I-abstract	against
I-abstract	an
I-abstract	instruction
I-abstract	set
I-abstract	architecture
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	example
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	verification
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	three
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	stage

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	broken
I-abstract	up
I-abstract	into
I-abstract	three

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	Localization
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	one
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	fundamental
I-abstract	problems
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robotics
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Without
I-abstract	knowledge
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	cannot
I-abstract	efficiently
I-abstract	carry
I-abstract	out
I-abstract	their
I-abstract	tasks
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	In
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	we
I-abstract	present
I-abstract	Markov
I-abstract	localization
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	estimating
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	key
I-abstract	idea
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	maintain
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	probability
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	over
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	whole
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	within
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	way
I-abstract	our
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	able
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	globally
I-abstract	localize
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	scratch
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	recover
I-abstract	from
I-abstract	localization
I-abstract	failures
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	property
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	essential
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	truly
I-abstract	autonomous
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	probabilistic
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	makes
I-abstract	this
I-abstract	approach
I-abstract	robust
I-abstract	against
I-abstract	approximate
I-abstract	models
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	environment
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	well
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	noisy
I-abstract	sensors
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	fine
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	grained
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	metric
I-abstract	discretization
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	state
I-abstract	space
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	Markov
I-abstract	localization
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	able
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	incorporate
I-abstract	raw
I-abstract	sensor
I-abstract	readings
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	does
I-abstract	not
I-abstract	require
I-abstract	predefined
I-abstract	landmarks
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	It
I-abstract	also
I-abstract	includes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	filtering
I-abstract	technique
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	allows
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	reliably
I-abstract	estimate
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	densely
I-abstract	populated
I-abstract	environments
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	We
I-abstract	furthermore
I-abstract	describe
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	how
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	explicit
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	density
I-abstract	can
I-abstract	be
I-abstract	exploited
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	reactive
I-abstract	collision
I-abstract	avoidance
I-abstract	system
I-abstract	to
I-abstract	increase
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robustness
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	reliability
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	robot
I-abstract	even
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	situations
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	which
I-abstract	it
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	uncertain
I-abstract	about
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	position
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	method
I-abstract	described
I-abstract	here
I-abstract	has
I-abstract	been
I-abstract	implemented
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	tested
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	several
I-abstract	real
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	world
I-abstract	applications
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	including
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	deployments
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	two
I-abstract	mobile
I-abstract	robots
I-abstract	as
I-abstract	interactive

I-abstract	This

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	A

I-abstract	for

I-abstract	of

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	investigates

I-abstract	that

I-abstract	They
I-abstract	pose
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	challenge
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	head
I-abstract	-
I-abstract	driven
I-abstract	semantics
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	HPSG-94
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	since

I-abstract	As
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	consequence
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	if
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	is
I-abstract	semantically

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	Technically
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	this

I-abstract	First
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	if

I-abstract	,
I-abstract	then
I-abstract	what

I-abstract	what

I-abstract	the

I-abstract	,

I-abstract	so
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	what
I-abstract	is
I-abstract	the

I-abstract	In

I-abstract	Abstract
I-abstract	This
I-abstract	paper
I-abstract	proposes
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	framework
I-abstract	for
I-abstract	development
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	exploitation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	a
I-abstract	corpus
I-abstract	,
I-abstract	based
I-abstract	on
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	HPSG
I-abstract	linguistic
I-abstract	theory
I-abstract	.
I-abstract	The
I-abstract	formal
I-abstract	representation
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	annotation
I-abstract	scheme
I-abstract	facilitates
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	annotation
I-abstract	process
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	ensures
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	quality
I-abstract	of
I-abstract	the
I-abstract	corpus
I-abstract	and
I-abstract	its
I-abstract	usage
I-abstract	in
I-abstract	different

I-abstract	.
I-abstract	Also
I-abstract	,
